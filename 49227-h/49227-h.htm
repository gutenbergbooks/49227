<p class="p44">KITTYLEEN.</p>


<hr class="r5" />




<h2 class="no-break"><a name="I" id="I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />

<small><small>KITTYLEEN.</small></small></h2>


<p>A pretty brown and white dove was
walking up the steep roof of Dr. Gray's
house just as the door-bell rang. Perhaps
she heard the bell, for she stopped and
pecked her wings, then flew down to the
ground, and looked up to see who was there.</p>

<p>It was Kittyleen. Kittyleen was a snip
of a girl, three years old, whose long name
was Katharine Garland. She looked like
the dove, for she was brown and white all
over: brown eyes and hair, brown cloak,
white fur cap, and white tippet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>Her young nurse, Martha, had come with
her, but there is not much to say here concerning
Martha, except that she had the toothache.
She did not intend to enter the house;
she had only come to escort Kittyleen.</p>

<p>"I want to wing the bell myse'f," said
Miss Kittyleen, standing on tiptoe, and
bursting a button off one of her brown boots.
But she could not reach the bell.</p>

<p>Just then the doctor's daughter, Mary
Gray, opened the door, and seeing Kittyleen,
threw both arms around her, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling, I'm so glad you've
come!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid you'll be sorry enough
by and by," said Martha, with a one-sided
smile, that made her look like a squirrel
with a nut in his cheek. "She's full of
mischief, Kittyleen is, and her ma's painting
china, and wanted her out of the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>But if she's <i>too</i> much trouble, her ma wants
you to send her right home."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>she</i> won't trouble anybody. She and
little Ethel will have a beautiful time together,"
said Mary, untying the child's white
tippet.</p>

<p>Mary Gray, or Flaxie Frizzle, as people
persisted in calling her sometimes, was nine
years old, and had for some time felt a great
care of Kittyleen. Everybody felt the care
of Mrs. Garland's children. There were six
of them, and their mother was always painting
china. She did it beautifully, with
graceful vines trailing over it, and golden
butterflies ready to alight on sprays of lovely
flowers. Sometimes the neighbors thought
it would be a fine thing if she would keep
her little ones at home rather more; but if
she had done that she could not have
painted china.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>Flaxie took off Kittyleen's fur cap, and
patted it softly, as she hung it on the hat-tree.</p>

<p>"That's my white pussy," remarked Kittyleen,
eying it lovingly. "But it don't
hurt; it hasn't any feet."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, pet, don't get into mischief,"
said Martha, making another wry
face as she tried to smile. And then, without
one word to Flaxie as to the length of
Kittyleen's visit, she hurried home to put a
poultice on her face and help about the ironing;
for, as she said to herself, "The work
was only fun, now the three youngest children
were out of the way."</p>

<p>Flaxie led Kittyleen into the back parlor
to show her to the family. Little Ethel did
not look particularly pleased, for she remembered
that the baby-guest was very fond of
sweetmeats, and sometimes snatched more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>than her share. Mrs. Gray was embroidering
a table-cover as a birthday present for
Aunt Jane Abbott, and was feeling very
much hurried; but she smiled and said to
Flaxie, as she kissed the wee visitor,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So your little pet has come again? Well,
we will do all we can to make her happy;
but you know Julia and I are both busy over
these presents, and you must take the chief
care of Kittyleen yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, you know I always do," replied
Flaxie; "and she behaves better with me
than she does with her mother."</p>

<p>Nobody thought of Kittyleen's staying
any longer than to dinner and supper; but
there was never any certainty about the
Garland children's visits, especially when it
began to storm. It began now at eleven
o'clock, and snowed all day without ceasing;
and then the wind rose, and blew the flakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>east and west and north and south, till the
men in the streets could hardly keep their
hats on their heads, much less hold an umbrella.</p>

<p>Of course Kittyleen couldn't go home
that night, for she lived on Prospect Street,
half a mile away. Preston Gray said with a
sarcastic smile that "it was a comfort to
know that her mother would be easy about
her."</p>

<p>But Kittyleen made a grieved lip. The
sun had set, there were no stars in the sky,
and the windows looked black and dismal.
She parted the curtains and peeped out.</p>

<p>"All dark out there," said she, sadly.
"Did God forget about the moon? I are
goin' to cry! Yes, Flaxie, I are; I want to
see my mamma, and I are goin' to cry."</p>

<p>Two tiny tears gathered in the dove-like
brown eyes, ready to fall. Dr. Gray rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>from his chair and paced the floor. He
never could bear to see a little girl cry.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said he,&mdash;"I do wonder
where Mary keeps that beautiful big wax
doll!"</p>

<p>"O papa!" said Flaxie, clasping her hands,
"<i>don't</i>, papa!"</p>

<p>"The wax doll is in my cabinet," replied
Mrs. Gray, not regarding her daughter's distress;
"and if Kittyleen won't cry she shall
see it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"O mamma, please don't," repeated Flaxie.</p>

<p>But Kittyleen was happy from that moment.
She <i>wanted</i> to stay now. She liked
Flaxie's chamber, with its fine pictures and
soft carpet, and the silk quilt upon the bed.
She liked Flaxie's "nightie," with its pretty
edging, and laughed because it had a "long
end to it," long enough to wrap up her little
pink toes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>Ethel, who was still younger than Kittyleen,
had gone to bed long ago; but Kittyleen
was too full of frolic, and when she went
at last she would not lie still, but kept springing
up and turning somersets all over the
bed, lisping, as she caught her breath, "See
dolly in the mornin'! Me velly much
obliged!"</p>

<p>"There, there, hush, Kittyleen," said
Flaxie, crossly, "I want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Wish I had dolly here now; want to luf
her <i>this</i> way," continued the little prattler,
smoothing Flaxie's cheek with her tiny hand.</p>

<p>"No, no, you mustn't love <i>my</i> doll in that
way; it isn't the way to love dolls. You
mustn't touch her at all; you mustn't go
anywhere near her, Kittyleen Garland," exclaimed
Flaxie, growing alarmed.</p>

<p>She had more treasures of value, perhaps,
than any other little girl in Rosewood, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>was always afraid of their being injured.
Indeed, she was too anxiously careful of some
of them, and it was partly for this reason
that her mother had promised to show Kittyleen
the wax doll. Of all Flaxie's possessions
this was the very chief, and she loved the
pretty image with as much of a mother's love
as a little girl is able to feel, always calling
her "my only child" in forgetfulness of all
her other dolls, black, white, and gray. The
"Princess Aurora Arozarena," as she was
called, was as large as a live baby six months
old. Flaxie had owned her for two years,
keeping her mostly in close confinement in
her mother's cabinet, and never allowing
little sister Ethel anything more than a
tantalizing glimpse of her majesty's lustrous
robes. This august being was dressed in
fine silk, with gloves and sash to match, and
always when she mounted the throne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
sometimes when she didn't, she wore a
crown upon her regal head. Her throne, I
may add, was a round cricket, dotted with
brass nails. You will see at once that it
would be no light trial to have this adorable
doll breathed upon by such a little gypsy as
Kittyleen.</p>

<p>"O mamma," pleaded Flaxie next morning,
"please hold her tight when you show"&mdash;and
then, as Kittyleen skipped into the
room she added, "Hold the w-a-x d-o-l-l tight
when you show it!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> heard," said Kittyleen. "Diddle
o-k-p-g! <i>I</i> heard!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray and Flaxie both laughed; but the
terrible child added, dancing up and down,
"See dolly <i>now</i>! me velly much obliged!"
"Me velly much obliged" was her way of
saying "if you please," and Flaxie often remarked
upon it as "very cunning"; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
saw nothing cunning in it now, and frowned
severely as Mrs. Gray led the way up-stairs
to her own chamber, unlocked the cabinet,
and took out the much-desired, crowned, and
glittering Aurora Arozarena.</p>

<p>"Kittyleen may look at it, but she is not
to touch it. Ethel never has touched it.
And when you hear the breakfast bell, Mary,
you may put the doll back in the cabinet,
and that will be the last of it; so try not to
look so wretched."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" cried Kittyleen, too full
of delight to do anything but scream. "Open
eyes! shut eyes! Oh! oh! oh!"</p>

<p>She did not offer to touch the shining
lady; and this grand exhibition <i>would</i> have
been the last of it if Flaxie had not somehow,
in her anxiety and haste, forgotten to
turn the key on the royal prisoner when she
put her back in the cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm was not over. The snow turned
to rain and poured continually. Mrs. Garland
had nearly time to paint a whole set of china;
for of course Kittyleen could not go home
that day.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the child, having quarrelled
with little Ethel, strayed alone into
Mrs. Gray's chamber. There on the great
bracket against the wall stood that wonderful
inlaid cabinet, pretty enough in itself to be
gazed at and examined by curious little folks,
even if there had been nothing inside. Kittyleen
knew, however, that it contained the doll&mdash;Flaxie's
doll&mdash;that was too sacred for little
girls to touch. She could not have told afterwards
why she did it, but she climbed on a
chair and pulled at one of the doors of the
cabinet. She certainly did not expect it
would open, but to her intense delight it did
open, and there in plain sight on a shelf lay
the beautiful princess, fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my!" exclaimed Kittyleen in a perfect
tremor of joy.</p>

<p>The princess lay there and smiled. You
could almost see her breathe.</p>

<p>"Mustn't touch!" whispered Kittyleen to
her meddling fingers.</p>

<p>Touch? Oh, no indeed!</p>

<p>But she swayed to and fro upon the chair
and gazed. And evermore as she gazed, the
longing grew upon her to know how much of
Princess Arozarena was wax and how much
was living flesh and blood. Had she teeth?
a tongue? were there two holes in that pretty
nose?</p>

<p>"I've got a nose, dolly, you've got a nose;
everybody in this house has got a nose, two
holes&mdash;way&mdash;in."</p>

<p>Here she picked a pin out of her collar and
flourished it over those waxen nostrils. If
they were hollow&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>Oh, she wasn't going to hurt dolly! Not
for anyfing in this world! But <i>would</i> the
pin go in? That was all she wanted to
know; and she never would know till she
tried. "Why, it went in just as easy!"
Such a tender, soft dolly!</p>

<p>Kittyleen admired her more than ever.
"<i>Some</i> dollies are <i>so</i> hard!"</p>

<p>But why did this one lie with her eyes
closed? She had slept long enough. "I
fink her eyes are booful. Wake up, dolly."
That was what Flaxie had said in the morning,
and dolly had opened her bright eyes
very wide. But she wouldn't open them
now for Kittyleen. Kittyleen blew upon
them; the lids would not stir.</p>

<p>"I fink it's funny! I fink it's velly
funny," said baby, her breath coming short
and fast. What <i>was</i> the way to get them
open? They must be in there just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
same. Yes, they <i>must</i> be in there; but
where?</p>

<p>She wouldn't hurt those dear eyes, oh,
not for anyfing! But the longer they hid
away from her the more she wanted to see
them. What <i>were</i> they made of?</p>

<p>There was one way to get at the secret
of their wondrous beauty. She could explore
a little with the pin. Dolly wasn't
alive; pins wouldn't hurt.</p>

<p>Gently! gently! Oh, yes, Kittyleen meant
to be very gentle! But somehow that
was a bad old pin! What made it bend
right up? What did make it dig so and
scratch?</p>

<p>I grieve to tell the rest. Princess Arozarena
had been beautiful, but when she
lost one eye she was horrid. Kittyleen
caught her up in remorse, and the other
eye flew open. Kittyleen screamed in fright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
It seemed as if the doll was alive, as if that
eye was looking right at her.</p>

<p>It was too much to bear. Trembling,
she opened the closet door, and threw the
poor, scratched, miserable doll, with her one
blazing eye, head-first into the clothes-bag.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="II" id="II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<small><small>THE LITTLE WIDOW.</small></small></h2>


<p>Did she go down-stairs then and tell anybody
what she had done? That would have
been the right way, but Kittyleen was only
a baby. She felt sadly frightened, and roved
all about the chambers crying, till Dora
Whalen heard her from the back stairs, and
took her down to the kitchen in her arms.
"The poor little thing is homesick," thought
Dora, and fed her with raisins.</p>

<p>When Flaxie went up to her mother's
room soon afterward, she saw that the cabinet
door was open and the doll gone, and
was much troubled, though not prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the worst. After long search, the mangled
remains of the once blooming princess were
brought to light, and then Flaxie's heart
almost broke. She could not be comforted,
and she could not forgive Kittyleen. It was
of no use suggesting a new head for the poor,
wounded doll. What was her mother thinking
of? Didn't she know that Arozarena
was just like a <i>person</i>? And who ever
heard of a person's losing one head, and
then going and having another fitted on?
"She wouldn't be my own child with a new
head and face; and you wouldn't talk of
such a thing, mamma, if you'd ever lost a
beautiful doll like this! You'd see the difference
and know how I feel."</p>

<p>Phil and little Ethel looked on with solemn
interest as their elder sister raved. So
sad a day as this had not been known in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>house since Preston's dear dog, Tantra Bogus,
ate poison by mistake and died. Princess
Arozarena was almost like living flesh
and blood to these little children. They
could not remember the time when she did
not exist, and it was really heartrending to
think now of her dire and unexpected fate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray dropped her work and told the
children of a sorrow she had known in her
own early youth as grievous as this. She,
too, had lost a bright, particular doll, and it
had come to its end by the teeth of a neighbor's
dog.</p>

<p>"Was it a mad dog?" asked Flaxie, with a
sob. And Phil wondered if his mother
could have cried.</p>

<p>"Indeed I cried."</p>

<p>"Why, you great, big, grown-up woman!
Oh, but you weren't our mother then, <i>were</i>
you? and you couldn't have been if you'd
tried, for we weren't born!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Having settled this in his mind, Phil saw
less absurdity in her crying over a doll.</p>

<p>"Naughty Kittyleen, pick folks' eyes
out," exclaimed little Ethel, returning to the
subject anew. "<i>Effel</i> wouldn't pick eyes
out! No, in-deed!"</p>

<p>Never before had the baby felt herself so
good and high-minded, so worthy of praise.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think Kittyleen ought to be shut up in
the closet and whipped," declared Phil; and
this opinion was so gratifying to Flaxie that
she kissed him, and said she should never
call him a naughty brother again.</p>

<p>"I suppose mother wouldn't shut her up
because she is a visitor, but I <i>should</i> think
she might send her home," muttered Flaxie,
angrily.</p>

<p>"My daughter, would you have me send
little Kittyleen home in the rain?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I think she has stayed long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>enough," sobbed Flaxie, pressing her hands
in anguish to her bosom.</p>

<p>"But she is such a little thing, hardly more
than a baby. I dare say she never dreamed
of spoiling your doll. You can't think the
child did it on purpose!"</p>

<p>"Of course she did! She's the queerest
girl," cried Phil, "can't stay at home, can't
let things alone. I think," pursued he,
encouraged by the curling of Flaxie's lip&mdash;"I
think 'twould be a good plan for Kittyleen
to go to Heaven! Folks don't want her
down here!"</p>

<p>"Stop, my son, that will do! we will not
talk any longer on this subject; but Mary, if
you please, you may hold some worsted for
me to wind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray hoped that a night's sleep would
soothe her daughter's grief; but the little
girl awoke next morning as sorrowful as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ever. Dark clouds were still lingering in
the wintry sky, and clouds quite as heavy
shut all the sunshine out of poor Flaxie's
heart. She came down to breakfast weeping,
a black scarf over her shoulders and a
bow of black ribbon pinned at her throat.
She had felt a melancholy desire to "go into
mourning," and let the world know that death
or worse than death had befallen her "only
child."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Dr. Gray,
who had quite forgotten yesterday's tragedy.</p>

<p>Phil spoke for her. He was getting into
high favor with his sister by his zeal in espousing
her cause.</p>

<p>"Flaxie's little girl is killed dead, and
Flaxie is a <i>widow</i> now," said he.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray raised his coffee-cup to his lips
to hide a smile. Kittyleen peeped up at the
little "widow" with innocent curiosity, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>was frowned down severely, and began to
cry. Her tears, however, were small and
few. She could not possibly grieve much
over her own naughtiness, committed so long
ago as yesterday; but even if she had been
as sorry as she ever knew how to be, the nice
buckwheat cakes and syrup would have consoled
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray was pained to see that Flaxie
still cherished bitter feeling against a child
of that tender age.</p>

<p>"My daughter," said she, after breakfast,
"if Kittyleen were older and had tried wilfully
to destroy your doll and make you unhappy,
I should not blame you so much.
But just see what a simple, unconscious little
thing she is, hardly wiser than your kitten.
Don't you feel really ashamed of being angry
with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I do," replied Flaxie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
hanging her head. "But it is hard to forgive
children sometimes, when they ought
to be at home, you know, and not going
'round to other people's houses to make
trouble!"</p>

<p>"Is Kittyleen at fault for going where
her mother sends her? You are old enough,
my daughter, to be more reasonable. Is
this the way you are beginning to receive
the discipline of your life?"</p>

<p>Flaxie knew what "discipline" meant. It
was the name her mother gave to all troubles,
both great and small, assuring Flaxie they
are sent to us in love, to do us good, unless,
alas, we receive them in a perverse spirit,
and then they only make us worse.</p>

<p>"You <i>can</i> forgive Kittyleen, my child;
God will help you; and until you do it you
will have no peace; you will live in darkness
and gloom. Go away by yourself for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and when I see you again I hope there will
be a little light in your soul."</p>

<p>About an hour afterward, Flaxie, with a
beaming smile, came into the parlor where
her sister Julia sat amusing Kittyleen. She
had a plate of golden-brown cookies in her
hand, baked in the form of stars, fishes, and
elephants.</p>

<p>"Here's a star for you, all sugar and
spice," said she very pleasantly to Kittyleen.
"And I'll forgive you for scratching my
doll all up and digging her eyes out. She's
just ruined, did you know it? <i>Ruined!</i> And
you're a bad little girl; <i>but I forgive you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Mary, my child, my child, is <i>that</i> what
you meant to say?"</p>

<p>The grieved look on Mrs. Gray's face
touched Flaxie's heart in a moment.</p>

<p>"No, mamma, it wasn't what I meant at
all. She isn't bad, and I didn't know I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>was going to say that. I do forgive you,
Kittyleen, really and truly. You never
meant the least harm. Kiss me, darling!
Flaxie loves you just the same, for you're
only a baby and didn't know any better."</p>

<p>There was no "half-way work" about this.
Kittyleen, perfectly willing to be forgiven,
nestled up to Flaxie and laid her soft cheek
against hers, murmuring, without meaning
anything at all,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me vely much obliged."</p>

<p>And at that moment the clouds broke
away and the tardy sun came out. A ray
of light shone over Mrs. Gray's face,&mdash;partly
sunshine from the sky, and partly an
inner sunshine from her happy heart. She
was a good mother, and nothing gave her
so much joy as to see her children rise
above selfishness and sincerely strive to
do right.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Kittyleen went home after dinner, loaded
with toys. Flaxie was the one to fasten her
cloak and tippet, and lead her by the hand
to the front door; but not a word did she
say to Martha about the "murder" of her
waxen child. Not a word did any one say
about it; and Mrs. Garland would never have
heard of Kittyleen's mischief if the little
one had not told of it herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Garland was quite disturbed, but his
wife was too busy painting to pay much
attention.</p>

<p>"My dear," said he, "Mary Gray is an
uncommon little girl to bear what she does
from Kittyleen. Suppose, as a reward for
her patience, you send her a handsome present
at Christmas."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Mrs. Garland, serenely,
"I'll send her a piece of the china
I'm painting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, she won't care anything about
that. Buy her something really pretty," said
Mr. Garland, who had no true love for the
fine arts, and secretly wished his wife's
paint-tubes and brushes were sunk in the
sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you may buy her something
yourself! I don't want to bother my head
about it," said Mrs. Garland, drawing a rim
of gold around a teacup.</p>

<p>And Mr. Garland, who could get no help
from his wife, was obliged to go to Mrs.
Prim, a particular friend of the Gray family,
and ask her what she thought Flaxie would
like for a Christmas present.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small><small>FLAXIE'S WILL.</small></small></h2>




<p>"<i>A doll's piano!</i> Why, if there is anything
in this world that I've always wanted,
it's just this little piano! And oh, to think
of Mr. Garland's giving it to me, when he
couldn't have known I wanted it! Did <i>you</i>
tell him, Preston? And oh, <i>see</i> the keys!
Hear me! There, that's the Grasshopper's
Dance! Tinkle! tinkle! tinkle! Oh, <i>so</i>
sweet! I couldn't play it any better on
my big piano, or half so well.</p>

<p>"Hush, Preston Gray, you needn't laugh!
What if I <i>am</i> nine years old? Can't I like
a little, cunning, beautiful doll's piano? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
what's the harm, when you know I needed
it to finish off the furniture in my dolls' parlor,
and go with the chairs and sofas and
tables and lamps and everything grand?</p>

<p>"This chair is just the thing for Princess
Aurora Arozarena to sit in when she plays
the piano. Now <i>would</i> you ever know any
thing had happened to Aurora? Only her
hair is a little darker, and her eyes are black
instead of blue, and she hasn't <i>quite</i> the
same kind of nose and mouth."</p>

<p>So Flaxie talked on and on; and the new
treasure, the doll's piano, was kept for a
long time in the back parlor in one of the
alcoves, that people from far and near might
hear and see it. The tiny white and black
keys gave all the notes with a merry little
tinkling sound that was enough to take a
doll right off its feet and set it to dancing.</p>

<p>A wee chair was always before it, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the chair sat the princess, who had come
to life again, and never knew she had been
dead. Her happy young mother, Flaxie
Frizzle, often knelt behind her, playing little
jingling, squeaking tunes, exactly adapted
to the ears of her royal highness, who
would have played for herself if her long-wristed,
light gloves had not been so exquisitely
tight.</p>

<p>The piano was a great comfort in itself;
and when Flaxie came to understand that
it was a token of Mr. Garland's approval and
gratitude, she valued it more than ever.</p>

<p>About this time she had a most uncomfortable
siege of chicken-pox, and was
obliged for two days to keep her room,
looking sadly disfigured by the pink, puffy
blotches which rose on her skin, and feeling
very forlorn because her poor red eyes were
too weak to admit of her reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does make me look so?" said she,
almost crying, as she gazed at her face in
the glass. "And, oh, Ninny, I feel a great
deal worse than I look! I can tell you people
wouldn't laugh so much about chicken-pox
if they knew how it feels!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I'm sure it must be dreadful,"
returned Ninny,&mdash;her real name was Julia,&mdash;with
ready sympathy. "You woke me up
ever so many times last night screaming."</p>

<p>"Screaming? Why, I didn't know it! I
must have been crazy!"</p>

<p>When ill, it was no unusual thing for the
Gray children to be slightly delirious; and
Flaxie often laughed over the droll speeches
which she was reported to have made, but
of which she herself could not recall a single
word.</p>

<p>"What did I say last night when I was
crazy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"You sat up in bed and cried for your
'<i>little pinono</i>,'&mdash;the doll's piano, I suppose.
And sometimes you seemed to think it had
turned into a wolf, for you kept saying,
'Why, what great, big teeth you've got!
Oh, they're to eat you the better, my
dear!'"</p>

<p>Flaxie smiled faintly, and then, feeling
very miserable, wiped away a tear, thinking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am very, very ill. How do I
know? Fannie Townsend never was crazy
in her life, nor Blanche Jones. And what
made doctor papa look at my tongue this
morning, unless he thought I was growing
worse? He gave me powders, too, and told
me to stay up-stairs and keep warm. Maybe
I'm going to have a fever. I didn't eat
anything for my breakfast but half a cracker,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>and my head aches so I don't want any dinner.&mdash;Julia,"
said she, interrupting herself
in the midst of these gloomy musings, "do
people ever die of chicken-pox?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, not that I ever heard of.
What put that into your head?"</p>

<p>"Now, Julia, you don't know the least
thing about it! What do <i>you</i> know about
fevers and medicines and things like that?
Just because your papa is a doctor, that's
no reason you should shake your head and
think there's nothing the matter with me,
when I'm feeling so bad!"</p>

<p>Julia would not, on any account, have
laughed at her poor little sister; so she
slipped quietly out of the room before Flaxie
had time to continue this train of absurd
and amusing remarks.</p>

<p>Finding herself alone, however, the reflections
of the chicken-pox patient grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>more and more sombre. What <i>was</i> the difference
between this and small-pox? She
had heard of a red flag which was hoisted
when that good clergyman, Mr. Branch, lay
ill in a house away from everybody, and at
last died, almost alone. Probably Doctor
Papa would never send a little girl like her&mdash;his
own daughter, too&mdash;to a house with
a red flag! Still she might die; and if she
did, Julia would naturally be very sorry she
had spoken so lightly&mdash;not to say disrespectfully&mdash;of
a disease whose miseries she
had never felt; that is, the chicken-pox.</p>

<p>An hour or two afterwards, Mrs. Prim
called at Flaxie's room, and after feeling
her pulse, and saying, "Oh, <i>you</i> are not very
ill," she turned to Grandma Gray, who had
come in, and began a conversation with her
about Blanche Jones's father.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Prim, "Mr. Jones is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>really aware at last that his disease is consumption.
He knows he can never recover,
and has made his will."</p>

<p>"Has he, indeed?" returned Grandma
Gray. "I am truly glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"I tell my husband," went on Mrs. Prim,
sitting very straight in her chair,&mdash;"I tell
my husband I think it is every man's duty
to make a will; yes, and every woman's
duty, too. Mr. Prim agrees with me, and we
each of us intend this very afternoon to have
our wills drawn up and signed."</p>

<p>"A wise and proper thing, I am sure,"
remarked Grandma Gray.</p>

<p>"Grandma," asked Flaxie, as soon as their
visitor had gone, "please tell me what's a will,
and why is it 'a wise and proper thing'?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, little Mary, I cannot make you
understand. But Mr. Prim has a great deal
of money, and so has Mrs. Prim; and if
either of them should die, perhaps it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
not be known what was best to do with the
money that was left. So Mr. Prim is going
to write his wishes about <i>his</i> money on a
sheet of paper. He is going to say, 'I wish
to give so many thousand dollars to my wife,
and so many thousand dollars to somebody
else,' etc. And Mrs. Prim will do the same
about <i>her</i> money. She will say, 'I wish to
give so many thousand dollars to Mr. Prim,
and so many thousand dollars to somebody
else,' etc."</p>

<p>"Well, if she wishes to give it, why
doesn't she do it, and not write about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she only means that she wishes it to
be given away after she is dead! Not <i>now</i>,
Mary!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes'm, I understand, I understand
now. Why, grandmamma, I've heard ever
so often about people's making wills, but I
never knew before what it meant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon, when Madam Gray had
quite forgotten this conversation, she was
startled by hearing Flaxie say plaintively,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grandma, do little girls ever make wills?"</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard of, my dear; but
they certainly have a right to do so, if they
like."</p>

<p>"Well, if they haven't a great deal of
money, can they give away something
besides money? I mean, have they a right
to make a will and give away their books and
toys and pretty things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"And is it 'wise and proper'? You know,"
added Flaxie, turning her aching head upon
the pillow,&mdash;"you know I have a great many
beautiful things, and if I ever die there is
my sweet little new piano, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
don't expect I <i>shall</i> die, but if I ever do die,
you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Madam Gray understood her granddaughter's
mood in a moment. Flaxie had a touch
of 'melancholy.' Though very well aware
that her disease was not of a dangerous
nature, she liked to fancy that it was dangerous.
Even now she had brought herself
almost to the verge of tears, just by picturing
to her own mind how sorry everybody
would feel when she actually died of chicken-pox.
Grandma Gray thought it might
amuse and interest her to let her make a
will, so she brought her a sheet of paper and
a pencil, and instructed her as to the proper
form of words to use.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of Flaxie's will:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, Mary Gray, of Laurel Grove, N. Y.,
third child of Dr. Ephraim Gray, do hereby
give and bequeath my personal property in
the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i> I give and bequeath my pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
doll's piano to Kittyleen Garland, whose real
name is Katharine. I give it to her, because
I was cross to her for scratching my
doll's eyes out, and have been sorry for
it ever since. To her heirs and assigns
forever.</p>

<p>"<i>Second.</i> I give and bequeath my beautiful
wax large doll with the new head to my
dear little sister Ethel; but she must not
play with it till she knows how to hold it
without letting it fall. I give this to Ethel,
her heirs and assigns forever.</p>

<p>"<i>Third.</i> My Bible and all my <i>nice</i> books,
and my gold pen and handsome inkstand to
my sister Julia, if she wants them.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourth.</i> The money in my box,&mdash;I don't
know whether to give it to my father or
mother or the missionaries.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifth.</i> I cannot think of anything more,
and am willing my papa and mamma should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
take care of the rest. Their heirs and
assigns forever."</p>

<p>"Shall I say amen at the end?" asked
Flaxie, who had become very much interested,
and already felt decidedly better.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied her father, who had come
in and was looking on with no little amusement;
"only sign your name, and then
your grandmother and Preston and I will
add our names also, as witnesses. Then it
will be a real will, my daughter, and will
stand in court."</p>

<p>Flaxie did not know what he meant by
"standing in court," but it sounded business-like
and mysterious, and she took the pen
her father offered her and signed her name
with a feeling of great importance. Then
Dr. Gray, grandma, and Preston added their
names, and her father put four seals of
red wax on the paper, and the whole thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
was finished, as she believed, "according
to law."</p>

<p>After this, for the first time that day, she
felt hungry; and just as she was beginning
to wonder if it was not nearly supper-time,
her mother appeared with the tea-tray, on
which were some slices of thin toast, a glass
of ruby-colored jelly, and a goblet of milk.
Flaxie's eyes brightened; she felt that life
was still worth living, and forgot to weave
any more doleful fancies concerning the
chicken-pox.</p>

<p>Next day she was well enough to go
down-stairs; and to add to the pleasure she
felt in meeting the whole family together
again, her father announced to her that as
soon as the disfiguring blotches should be
gone from her face, she might take a
little journey to Hilltop to "regain her
strength."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>That was just like Doctor Papa. He was
always giving his children happy surprises;
and it was really a blessing to belong to
him, and even to be ill once in a while, for
the sake of the compensation which he
always managed should follow the illness.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small><small>CRACKERS AND CHEESE.</small></small></h2>





<p>But there is always a drop of bitter in
our sweetest cup. In Flaxie's cup just now
were two bitter drops.</p>

<p>First, though she longed for the visit, she
regretted to miss "dear, darling Miss Pike,"
who was coming from Hilltop next week.
Still, as this excellent lady intended to spend
the winter at Dr. Gray's as governess in
his family, Flaxie's being gone at the very
first of her stay did not really matter so
much.</p>

<p>As for the second bitter drop, it seemed
to Flaxie that if she could only take this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
journey alone, with the sole care of her own
self, her own ticket, and her own valise, she
should be "perfectly happy." She was no
longer so <i>very</i> young. Last summer she had
seen a girl of her own age travelling alone,
with a book, a parasol, and a paper of candy;
and the girl had carried her head so grandly,
as if it had long been her habit to manage
her own affairs, and she had looked withal so
fascinating and distinguished, that Flaxie had
often thought of her with envy. Why was
<i>she</i> always considered so young and insignificant?
What was lacking in <i>her</i> that she
could not also travel alone?</p>

<p>"Why, Frizzle dear, you'd get switched
off to Canada or something," said Preston.
"I shall go with you to keep you on the
right track." But Flaxie insisted.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm nine years old and three
months and six days; and it's only the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>bit of a ride to Hilltop, and I know every
step of the way."</p>

<p>"You'd make a comical appearance travelling
alone, now, wouldn't you?" returned
Preston, who, though the dearest brother in
the world, was becoming of late too much of
a tease. He wore steel-bowed spectacles,
and his eyes laughed through them sometimes
with a dazzling, flashing light, which
his little sister could not bear to meet. He
thought she had too high an opinion of herself,
and he "liked," as he expressed it, "to
take her down."</p>

<p>"I am not sure, indeed, that Flaxie would
not have been allowed by her parents to go
to Hilltop alone if it had not been for this
same desire of Preston's to take her down."</p>

<p>Ah, well, there are greater trials in life
than travelling with a dear elder brother,
even if he does laugh at you once in a while.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>But I must describe this journey, which you
will see turned out, after all, rather differently
from what Preston expected.</p>

<p>Flaxie packed her three favorite common
dolls, Peppermint Drop, Dr. Smith, and
Christie Gretchen, her box of water-colors,
her charcoal and drawing-paper, all her
games and part of her books; but was persuaded
to take out some of these articles, in
order to make room for her clothes. A
valise will not hold everything, and clothes
are needed, even for a two weeks' visit.
Julia wove her sister's flaxen curls tightly
together in one long braid, so that it might
remain smooth during the journey, and
Flaxie stood a long while before the hall
mirror, pulling her hat this way and that,
to make sure it was straight. In her excitement
she had hardly stopped to eat any
breakfast; but when the good-bys were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
over, and she was walking to the station
with Preston, she suddenly recollected this,
and complained to him that she was hungry.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a funny idea! I believe
girls are always hungry," he responded.</p>

<p>Still the thought disturbed him. He
never could bear to have anybody uncomfortable,
and, of course, he would not allow
his little sister to start on a journey fasting.</p>

<p>"See here, Flaxie, we haven't time now
to go back for anything to eat; but couldn't
you nibble a cracker, or a ginger-snap, or
something?"</p>

<p>And he led her into a small grocery,
where a man stood behind the counter selling
a paper of cloves. There were no
ginger-snaps to be had, but the man succeeded
in finding some very dry, hard crackers
at the bottom of a barrel. Flaxie did
not want the crackers, but thought it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be impolite to say so. Still less did she
want the mouldy, crumbling cheese, which
he produced from its hiding-place under a
box. She looked on in silence while he cut
off a pound of this and weighed it in a piece
of brown paper.</p>

<p>"Take one of these crackers, Chicky, and
put it in your pocket," said Preston, in the
kindest possible manner; and Flaxie obeyed
him, looking rather downcast. She wished
she had not complained of needing food.</p>

<p>There were seventeen more crackers; and
these the grocer counted out, and put in a
paper bag, scarcely large enough to hold
them. He was a slow man, who walked with
crutches; and while he was debating whether
to get a larger bag or to tie this one up with
a string, a steam-whistle was heard, and the
cars whizzed by the door.</p>

<p>Flaxie darted out in quick alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry now, don't worry! I
know what I'm about, <i>I</i> never get left," said
Preston, in a reassuring tone. He would
have liked it much better if Flaxie had relied
entirely upon him. "They are going
to stop at the station to take in freight.
People will laugh at you if they see you
run."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was running, too; for even
as he spoke he happened to remember that
this train did not always stop for freight; and
indeed it did not wait now five minutes.
The children reached the station out of
breath, and Preston had a scramble to buy
tickets, check Flaxie's valise, and enter the
cars with her before the train moved off. It
was rather mortifying; but he did not allow
himself to look in the least chagrined. He
adjusted his spectacles, threw his head back
a little, and gazed about him coolly, as if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>particularly liked to be late, and would not on
any account have come earlier.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>"Why, if there isn't Kittyleen!" said
Flaxie.</p>

<p>But Kittyleen was only going to Rosewood,
the next station. "Marfa" was with her, and
would bring her back next day "if she was
willing to come."</p>

<p>Flaxie did not seat herself at once. She
had a little chat with Kittyleen, after which
I regret to say she stood on her tiptoes for
some moments, gazing in the mirror at the
farther end of the car.</p>

<p>"There, there, sit down, Chicky, your hat
is all right," said Preston, who considered
her the prettiest little girl he knew, and felt
that she did him credit. "And here are
your check and your ticket. If you ever
expect to travel alone you must learn to take
care of your things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know it! I always keep my
ticket when I ride with papa; and very often
he goes into another car and leaves me
alone," remarked Flaxie.</p>

<p>If this was meant as a hint, it was lost on
Preston. He began to read a newspaper,
while his young companion looked out of the
window at the trees, houses, and fences that
flew past in a dizzy blur. She thought she
would count the trees, just to amuse herself,
and had got as far as eighty-seven, when
Preston suddenly tapped her on the shoulder.
The conductor was standing near, waiting
for her ticket. Rather bewildered, yet anxious
to appear prompt and experienced, she
put her hand hastily in her pocket, and drew
forth, not her ticket, but that miserable, forgotten
cracker.</p>

<p>The conductor, a good-natured, red-cheeked
man, said, "No, I thank you," and shook his
sides with laughing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>Flaxie blushed painfully. Once she would
not have minded it so very much, for she had
been formerly a pert child; but in growing
older, she was growing more modest, sensitive,
and retiring. She withdrew the
cracker and produced the ticket, feeling with
shame that she was behaving very unlike the
elegant little girl who travelled with a book,
a parasol, and a paper of candy.</p>

<p>But she was to suffer still more. The
conductor had scarcely passed out of hearing
when Preston said, in his wise, elder-brotherly
tone, "Here, child, if this is the way
you're going to behave, I might as well have
that ticket myself; your check, too. Oh, yes,
and give me the key to your valise, and now
your porte-monnaie. Wouldn't you like to
have me take care of your handkerchief?"
He spoke half in jest, still it was quite too
bad of him, for Flaxie was not a careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
child; neither did she need "taking down,"
or at all events, she did not need it any more
than Preston himself.</p>

<p>"I don't see what makes you think I'm
such a baby. I'm only four years younger
than you," she remonstrated, sighing heavily
as she handed to him, one after another,
the contents of her little cloak-pocket. He
took them from her with a condescending
smile.</p>

<p>"There, now, I feel easier," said he, settling
himself comfortably; "you'll have all
<i>you</i> want to do to take care of the crackers
and cheese. Why don't you eat them instead
of offering them to the conductor? He
has had his breakfast. Won't they laugh,
though, at home, when I tell them about
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Preston Gray, if you do tell about
that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Flaxie had borne her trials thus far with
patience, but now the tears started and
she was battling to keep them back. Preston
saw that he had gone too far, and though
secretly wondering why it was that "girls
can never take jokes," he resolved to make
himself more agreeable during the rest of
the journey.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<small><small>SPONGE-CAKE.</small></small></h2>




<p>"Those crackers aren't very nice, that's
a fact," said he, looking penitently at the
overflowing paper bag, which stood upright
on the seat between them.</p>

<p>"Not half as bad as the cheese," returned
Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't blame you for not liking
mouldy cheese; I don't like it myself," admitted
Preston. "But I suppose, now,
Chicky, if you had a piece of pie or a cake
or a sandwich, you'd enjoy it, and feel more
comfortable, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>The gentle tone and manner touched his
little sister, and called back her happiest
smiles in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care the least bit about anything!
I'm not very hungry, Preston;
really I'm not."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't want you to be hungry
at all," said the benevolent brother. "I
want people that travel with me to feel all
right and have a good time." Here he took
out his purse and looked at the silver in it;
there seemed to be plenty. "I wish a boy
would come in with something besides pop-corn
and peanuts, and all that sort of nonsense,
don't you? I'll tell you what I'll
do," added he, returning the purse to his
pocket. "I'll get out at Bremen and buy
you a great square of sponge-cake."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Preston, you can't buy it there!"</p>

<p>"What's the reason I can't?"</p>

<p>"Because they don't keep it at Bremen.
Sharon is the place; <i>Sharon</i>, near Hilltop."</p>

<p>"Where did you get your information?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
returned the lad, rather ruffled. "As often as
I've travelled this road I think I ought to
know that Bremen is a famous place for
sponge-cake. There's an old woman living
there that bakes it by the ton."</p>

<p>"Why, Preston Gray, that old woman lives
at <i>Sharon</i>! I've seen her my own self. Don't
you suppose I know? Why, Uncle Ben has
bought sponge-cake of her ever so many times
and brought it home to Aunt Charlotte."</p>

<p>One of Preston's dazzling smiles shone
through his spectacles as he rejoined,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say he has bought sponge-cake
and carried it home to Aunt Charlotte; but
that's no sign he has bought it at Sharon.
You're mistaken, that's all. Now when you
get to Bremen, and you see people stepping
out of this car and coming back loaded with
sponge-cake, perhaps you'll give up that I'm
right."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>Flaxie was ready to retort what she did not
believe people <i>would</i> get out at Bremen, or if
they did they would not find any cake. She
was fond of having the last word, but remembering
her blunder with the cracker, she said
no more, and even thought meekly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, well, perhaps it <i>is</i> Bremen! I almost
hope so, for I don't want to wait till we get
to Sharon."</p>

<p>She had regained her spirits by this time,
and found it very pleasant to be travelling
with a kind brother like Preston, who had
not a fault in the world except looking down
upon her rather too much.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the train halted at Bremen,
a small way-station. It did not look at
all familiar to Preston. He had supposed
Bremen was much larger, but that was probably
because he had not been on this road
for a whole year, and had forgotten some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the stopping-places. The famous old cake-woman;
could it be that she lived here? He
had half a mind to ask the conductor; but
no; Flaxie would hear him.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you getting out?" said she.</p>

<p>To be sure he was. He was already hurrying
down the aisle, too proud to confess that
he could possibly have made a mistake.</p>

<p>He was just behind a woman with a baby
in her arms, and had to wait for both the
baby and the woman to be helped out. By
the time he had got out himself, and before
he had a moment to look around him, the
cars were moving on again!</p>

<p>It was the most astonishing thing! There
he stood at the door of a wretched little
wood-shed, close by the platform, swinging,
his arms and crying, "Stop! stop!" But
nobody heard except the baby and its mother,
and nobody answered except the baby with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
an "Argoo, argoo," out of its silly little
throat. So this was Bremen! This wood-shed
and two or three houses!</p>

<p>It was a sad predicament for Preston, but
a worse one for Flaxie. She, too, cried,
"Stop! stop!" bounding up and down on
the seat like an India-rubber ball. But the
cars paid as little heed to her as they had
paid to her brother. On they went, rattle,
rattle, rattle. What cared they for a passenger
overboard? What cared they for a passenger's
sister left frantic and forlorn?</p>

<p>She would have appealed to the conductor,
but he was in the next car. So was the
brakeman, so was even the pop-corn boy.</p>

<p>The people went on talking and reading
without minding her. They probably
thought her a very restless child, for they
had not seen her quiet that morning. So it
was not till she began to wring her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and sob aloud that they suspected anything
unusual had happened.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, little girl?" asked
an old lady, leaning forward and offering
her a paper of sassafras lozenges. Flaxie
waved it away.</p>

<p>"Was it your brother that just left the
car?" asked a kind old gentleman, suddenly
recollecting the handsome lad in spectacles.
"Did he get out on purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir! on purpose to get
me some cake! But he's lost over! Oh,
dear, he's lost over! I can't make 'em
stop."</p>

<p>"How far were you going, my child?"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>know</i> how far. I'm going to
Hilltop to see Milly Allen. I don't <i>know</i>
how far! Oh, dear, I didn't want any cake.
I told him I wasn't <i>very</i> hungry. I told him
the old woman lived at <i>Sharon</i>. He didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
believe what I said, and that's why he got
left! Oh, dear, if he hadn't got out!"</p>

<p>"It isn't safe to get out unless you know
where you are going," said the old lady
wisely; but the remark did not seem to be
of any particular use just now. And then
she put the sassafras lozenges back in her
satchel. <i>They</i> didn't seem to be of any particular
use, either.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" wailed Flaxie, "if I'd only
travelled alone! I wanted to travel alone!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman did not quite understand.
It seemed to him that she certainly
<i>was</i> travelling alone, and if that was what
she wanted she ought to be satisfied.</p>

<p>He folded his newspaper, put it in his hat,
and came to sit down beside her. He was a
better comforter than the old lady, for he had
a dozen dear grandchildren at home, while
she, poor soul, had only a tortoise-shell cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't shed another least drop of a
tear," said the good old gentleman, hitting
and upsetting the crackers, which tumbled
out of the bag upon the floor. "Not one
tear would I shed," said he, picking up the
crackers. "Your brother will come on to
Hilltop to-morrow, or maybe he can come
this very afternoon; and then won't you
both laugh about this? You'll ask him,
'Where's that cake?' And what do you
suppose he'll answer to that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want the cake; <i>that</i> isn't
what I want. My head aches and my throat
aches, and I've just had the chicken-pox; and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
dear, I wish I was at home!"</p>

<p>"Where is your home, my little girl?"</p>

<p>"My home is at Laurel Grove, near
Rosewood."</p>

<p>"And what is your name and your father's
name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is Dr. Gray, and I am Mary Frances
Gray."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! Why, I know your father
very well," said the cheery old gentleman.
"Will you shake hands? There, now, we're
good friends, aren't we? And I'm going to
Hilltop and beyond. I'm Dr. White,&mdash;tell
your papa,&mdash;<i>old</i> Dr. White. Let's see,
have you any ticket?"</p>

<p>Flaxie uttered a cry of despair. Till that
moment she had not realized the full extent
of her woes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Preston took my ticket, and my
money, and <i>all</i> my things! Oh, <i>should</i> you
have thought he would?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well; we'll see what we can do,"
said Dr. White.</p>

<p>"Oh, when I get to Hilltop I can't open
my valise, for where's my check? I mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>my key! Oh, if I'd travelled alone! Preston
wanted to take care of me; but he's
taken care of me <i>too much</i>!"</p>

<p>Dr. White found it hard to keep his face
properly sober; yet he knew his little friend
would consider a smile very ill-timed.</p>

<p>"I've been to Hilltop more than ever he
has, for Milly Allen is just my age; and I
could have gone alone <i>beau</i>tifully. He has
bothered me so. But he didn't mean to
bother me," added she, ashamed to complain
of him before a stranger. "Only&mdash;"
Here she sprang up suddenly, and those
miserable crackers rolled out again, followed
by the cheese,&mdash;"only I ought to have a
ticket, you know. Do conductors ever let
you travel without your ticket?" asked she,
raising her brimming eyes anxiously to her
new friend's face.</p>

<p>"It depends upon circumstances, Miss
Mary. This conductor will do it, I'll be
bound."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will he? Oh, I'm so glad!" said Flaxie,
greatly relieved, though rather surprised.
Why should this conductor let <i>her</i> go free?
He had never seen her before, and knew
nothing about her except that she carried
crackers in her pocket. He appeared presently,
smiling and holding out his hand;
but after Dr. White had said something to
him in a low tone, he patted Flaxie's head
with an "All right. Don't lose your luncheon,
my dear," and passed on to the next seat.</p>

<p>"Did you tell him how my brother got
lost over? Did you tell him everything?"
asked Flaxie, looking quite gay and excited.</p>

<p>"Yes, almost everything. And now your
troubles are over, Miss Mary, for he will
give your name to the new conductor, and
then when we get to Hilltop I can put you
in a hack that will take you right to your
uncle's door."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, I don't want any hack!
Uncle Ben will be there, waiting for me, with
a sleigh, and Cousin Freddy, too. They
always come to the depot with a sleigh,
except in the summer, and then they come
with a carryall or a wagon."</p>

<p>And, in truth, on arriving at Hilltop, the
first persons to be seen were Uncle Ben
Allen, his son Freddy, and, best of all, his
daughter Milly, Flaxie's darling "twin
cousin."</p>

<p>"But where's Preston?" asked Freddy.</p>

<p>"He stopped at a wood shed on the way,
to buy a piece of sponge-cake," replied Dr.
White, shaking hands with Uncle Ben, as
Freddy tucked Flaxie into the sleigh.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<small><small>A NEW FRIEND.</small></small></h2>




<p>Preston lingered at the wood-shed and
about the tiny station of Bremen all that
morning and most of the afternoon. It was
a very solitary place, and he had ample time
for reflection.</p>

<p>"Well, this is one way to take care of
your little sister! Anybody'd think I was
five years old! I can't stand it to be such a
fool! Oh ho! I thought 'twas great fun,
didn't I, to make her give up her money and
tickets? I wanted to 'take her down,' but
now I'm taken down myself, and how do I
like it?"</p>

<p>To judge by his clouded face and the
stamping he made with his heels, he did not
like it at all. "Poor little Flaxie, I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
she's rushing round that car and crying!
What will she do with herself? <i>She</i> won't
get off anywhere? Oh, no, <i>Flaxie</i> isn't such
a goose as to get off a car unless there's
some sense in it! There's only one goose
in the family, and that's Preston Gray. No,
<i>she</i> won't get off. And let's see, the conductor
will remember her, on account of that
cracker. He'll know she did have a ticket,
so of course he'll let her go free. <i>She</i>'ll do
well enough. She'll make friends on the
cars; she's always making friends, she's so
pretty and sweet."</p>

<p>In this way, by praising his sister and
scolding himself, Preston tried to find a little
consolation as he strode up and down the
narrow sleigh-track&mdash;which the people of
Bremen called a road. What he ought to do
he could not decide.</p>

<p>After a while a man came along the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
dragging a pail of flour on a sled. "Do you
know how far it is to Hilltop, sir?" asked
Preston, feeling himself very young and
small, for the man stared at him as if <i>he</i> considered
him a mere baby, and thought of taking
him up pickaback.</p>

<p>"Hilltop, did you ask? Why, where are
your folks? Where did you come from,
travelling round here alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I came from Laurel Grove, just the
other side of Rosewood," replied Preston, as
dignified as a boy <i>can</i> be who feels himself
crushed to the earth by unmerited contempt.
"I got off the cars a few minutes ago, and&mdash;and&mdash;thought
I'd wait for the next train.
When does the next train go?"</p>

<p>"Well, it beats me to guess what you got
off the cars for!" said this very disrespectful
man, setting one foot on the sled and eying
Preston all over. "You hadn't ought to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
off the cars, sonny, it ain't safe; children get
their necks broke that way."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me how far it is to Hilltop?"
asked Preston, with an increase of dignity.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good fifty miles or more, and
you can't go till five o'clock this afternoon.
You'd better speak to the folks that live in
that red house yonder, and ask 'em to see
you safe on board the cars, and when you
once get on, you stick there! Don't you get
off this side of Hilltop. Now mind, little
shaver!" And with this very cutting advice
and another disrespectful stare, the man toiled
on with his sled and the pail of flour.</p>

<p>"I hope he was impolite enough,"
thought Preston, indignantly. He did not
relish being looked down upon. Neither had
Flaxie relished it, you remember. "So I
can't get to Hilltop till evening. A pretty
piece of work! They'll be just rising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the supper-table, Flaxie and all; and won't
they have a jolly time laughing at me?
They'll ask what I came for at that time of
day? Freddy'll call me a caterpillar and a
snail, and everything else he can think of.
No, <i>sir</i>, you don't catch me going to Hilltop
to be laughed at! All I went for in the first
place was to take care of Flaxie. No fun in
it now. No use, either! Guess I'll go home.
But what shall I do with the check and the
purse and the key? Oh, Flaxie, I wish I'd
let you alone."</p>

<p>While he was lamenting in this strain, he
became conscious of a pair of sorrowful eyes
raised to his face. They were the eyes of
a thin and unhappy-looking but handsome
black and white spaniel. It was a tender,
respectful gaze; and to a boy who has just
felt himself looked down upon, it is consoling
to be looked up to, even by a dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Rover, Rover, good fellow! Here,
Rover," said he, softly patting the shaggy
head.</p>

<p>There was a magical charm for all animals
in Preston's touch; and this poor creature
crouched before him with a mournful, loving
whine, got in front of him as he moved about,
sat down at his feet and licked his boots when
he stood still, and behaved altogether as if he
had found a dear friend.</p>

<p>"I can't think what you mean, Rover.
There, that's your name, I know by the way
you wag your tail! But, Rover, you never
saw <i>me</i> before. What makes you think you
know me?"</p>

<p>The handsome animal whined again at the
sound of Preston's voice, pushing his nose
into the boy's hand, and going off into a sort
of dog-ecstasy. It was really quite touching.
All the more so as there was something in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>the curl of his tail, the droop of his ears, that
suggested to Preston his own lost dog, the
beloved and ever-lamented Tantra Bogus.</p>

<p>"Tantra Bogus was larger and sleeker and
fatter, but he had the same white spot in his
forehead and his eyes were the same color,"
said Preston, his heart stirred with tender
memories, as he stooped and laid his cheek
lovingly against the rough black face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rover, you do love me! But I can't
see why! I guessed your name, and I'll
warrant I can guess who your master is, too.
It's that impudent man with the sled. Because,
sir, you've been half starved, and he's
just the man to starve a dog."</p>

<p>There was a crunching sound in the snow,
and Preston looked up, half expecting to see
the "impudent man" again; but this time it
was a lady. Certainly they had strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>people in Bremen, for this lady was the ugliest
being he had ever seen. Large, half-open
lips, big red nose, small red eyes.
But he did not forget to raise his cap respectfully.</p>

<p>"Dear old Rover, I'm glad he's found a
friend at last," said the lady to Preston, in
the sweetest tones. "He lost his master
three weeks ago, and mourns him so much
that it is very pitiful. He won't stay in the
house with his master's family, but lingers
about this shed day and night."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, poor fellow," said Preston;
and the dog capered about him, going out of
his head again with rapture.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lady, setting down a little
bundle in the snow, and weaving the silver
pin more securely into her shawl, "you are
the very first person Rover has cared for, or
taken the least notice of. The family are
afraid he will starve to death. There, now!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
I have an idea! But perhaps you are in a
hurry?" added she, with a particularly sweet
smile. It was surprising how an ugly mouth
like hers could smile so agreeably.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, no hurry. I've got to wait
seven hours. Going to&mdash;going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Preston's words were lost in an indistinct
muttering, his mouth being pretty
close to Rover's nose.</p>

<p>"Then if you'll wait here a few minutes
I'll bring Rover something to eat. They'll
all be so glad; and perhaps he'll take it
from <i>you</i>, though he won't from any one else."</p>

<p>Observe, she did not address Preston as
"sonny," or call him a "shaver." She did
not even say "my boy" or "my child" or
"my dear," or ask him any embarrassing
questions.</p>

<p>He was convinced that she was a perfect
lady, and answered briskly,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, do bring him a piece of meat, ma'am!
You see I can wait, for I'm going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>But not knowing whether to say Hilltop
or Laurel Grove, he prudently left the sentence
unfinished.</p>

<p>The lady hastened to the red house near
by, and Preston, still caressing the dog,
watched her as she returned with a light
step, bearing a plate of meat in her hand.
There was something very interesting about
her homeliness; he could not help looking
at her face, and the more he looked the
better he liked it.</p>

<p>"This is nice roast beef, a real Thanksgiving
dinner, Rover," said she, with loving
good-will. "Do eat it and make me happy."</p>

<p>As if he were grateful, and really anxious
to please her, this dog, who had so long refused
his food, thrust his nose immediately
into the heaped-up plate before him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
began to eat. If Preston moved away, however,
he stopped, turned about, and followed
him uneasily.</p>

<p>"It is very plain that the charm lies in
you," said the lady, smiling, as Preston
patted Rover's head, and he began to eat
again.</p>

<p>It had been dreadful, she said, to see him
pining away, and to hear him moaning day
and night. Mrs. Danforth, his master's
widow, could hardly bear it, and her son,
who lived with her, had declared that Rover
must be taken out of town and given to a
new master or he would surely die of grief.</p>

<p>"Now look here, ma'am," cried Preston,
looking up with sudden animation, "why
couldn't he go home with me? I've lost my
dog. Why couldn't he go home with me
and be <i>my</i> dog, you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not, if you would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
him. I know Mr. Danforth would be glad
to give him up to a boy so kind as you are.
Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"At Laurel Grove, ma'am." And feeling
a growing desire to stand well in the lady's
esteem, he tried to explain the situation.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;perhaps I sha'n't go home&mdash;that
is, not to-day. I didn't know what I
<i>should</i> do. I stopped here on the way. I
hadn't decided, you know," said he, vaguely.</p>

<p>The lady looked at him in some surprise.
Perhaps she doubted whether he could be
trusted with a dog. But she did not say
anything like that. "Do you live at Laurel
Grove? Why, that is just where <i>I</i> am
going. I came from Hilltop yesterday to
visit the Danforths on my way, and I'm
going to Laurel Grove to-day, to Dr. Gray's."</p>

<p>"Why, Dr. Gray is my father! And now
I know who <i>you</i> are. You're Miss Pike! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>might have known it was you," he went on,
thinking aloud, "for you look just as I
expected you would."</p>

<p>He could not dream how this little speech
hurt Miss Pike. She had moved forward to
shake hands with him, but at his last words
her cheeks flushed and she drew back again.
Was she thinking that very likely he had
heard her called "that homely Miss Pike?"</p>

<p>But the next moment she smiled pleasantly,
holding out her hand.</p>

<p>"And now I know who <i>you</i> are. You're
Master Preston Gray. 'I might have known
it was you, for you look just as I expected
you would!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Flaxie told you I wore spectacles,
<i>didn't</i> she?" Preston was somewhat sensitive
about those. "I have to wear them, for
if I take them off I'm blind almost," said he
by way of apology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know, you dear blessed boy!
Your sister has told me, and all the Allen
family have told me, too, how patient you've
been. I'm so glad I've met you, Master
Preston. And now what shall I say to your
father when I shall see him to-day?"</p>

<p>The boy looked up, and then he looked
down. "Oh, are you going to see my father
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall start at three o'clock this
afternoon in the baggage-car. I'm told
there's no passenger-car, and I must go as
baggage, or wait till six o'clock to-morrow
morning, and I don't like to start so early as
that, should you?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I shouldn't; it's pretty dark
at six. Look here, Miss Pike, if I take
Rover I shall have to take him in the baggage
car, sha'n't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I've a good mind to take him
to-day, if Mr. Danforth will let me. I don't
want to go to Hilltop now; it isn't very convenient."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Miss Pike.</p>

<p>"I didn't care much about going to Hilltop
anyway, not now; I only came to take
care of my little sister."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Miss Pike again, with an
upward slide to her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you think I didn't take
care of her very well. I suppose you think
it's sort of queer my being here, but you
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he struggled so long with something
in his throat that she helped him by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, possibly you got left."</p>

<p>What a bright, far-seeing woman she was!</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I did get left. That was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>just how it was. If it had not been for trying
to get some sponge-cake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you stopped here," broke
in the delightful Miss Pike, who seemed to
care nothing at all about the little particulars.
So good of her <i>not</i> to care! "I'm
glad I met you. And as your little sister
will not need you any more, couldn't you go
home this afternoon to be company for me?&mdash;Why,
just see, Rover has eaten every bit
of his dinner!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like to go with you, ma'am, if I
hadn't carried off Flaxie's check and key,"
demurred Preston. "You see, I took them
to keep them safe."</p>

<p>Rather too safe, Miss Pike thought; but
she said, without the shadow of a smile,
"Why not send the key and check to your
sister by mail?"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small><small>THAT HOMELY MISS PIKE.</small></small></h2>




<p>And so it was settled. Preston dined at
the red house; and Mr. Danforth, who
turned out to be a very different person from
the man with the sled, was glad enough to
give up Rover to a gentle, well-bred little
boy, who would be sure to treat him kindly.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before," said Mr. Danforth,
"but I know your father very well;
and I am not afraid to trust my dog to the
care of Dr. Gray's son."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Miss Pike and Preston and
Rover had a very cosey ride home that afternoon
in the baggage-car. So very cosey it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>was and so social, with nobody to disturb
them but the baggage-master occasionally
coming in and going out, that Preston almost
laid his heart bare before the kindly Miss
Pike. He told her how dreadful it was to
have your eyes cut with sharp instruments;
how tedious it was to recite Latin to Mr.
Garland; how fine it would be to leave off
study and become a gentleman farmer, with
the chance of receiving silver prizes for
sheep and poultry.</p>

<p>She listened with motherly sympathy, and
he was tempted to go still further, and relate
the history of all his sisters and his little
brother. It might amuse her to hear
Flaxie's great composition, entitled "Domestic
Animals," the one she wrote last fall, that
had been so freely laughed at by everybody
far and near. He knew it by heart, every
single word of it; but just as he was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to say, "Oh, Miss Pike, would you like
to hear what a funny composition Flaxie
wrote last fall?" a sudden thought checked
him.</p>

<p>Was this a kind thing to do? The composition
was very foolish, certainly, but his
little sister had long ago grown thoroughly
ashamed of it, though very proud of it at
first.</p>

<p>"It would cut her up dreadfully to have
Miss Pike hear it. So what's the use? I'm
sure I don't like to have Flaxie make fun of
<i>me</i>," thought he. He had been greatly humbled
to-day, and nothing makes us so tender
of others as suffering keenly ourselves.</p>

<p>Miss Pike had been struck from the first
with the remarkably frank and noble expression
of Preston's face. Possibly she would
have admired him still more if she had known
of the temptation he was resisting. It <i>was</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
temptation, for the composition would have
amused Miss Pike, and he knew it. Here it
is, that you may see it for yourselves.</p>


<p class="p11"><big>FLAXIE'S COMPOSITION.</big><br />

"DOMESTIC ANIMALS.</p>

<p>"There is classed throughout the species
domestic animals. The cat is very domestic,
and the turkey and the spider and the cow.
The elephant is not very domestic, but he is
a very useful animal. The pig is a very useful
animal and very domestic. Were it not
for the pig, what should we have to bake with
our beans, or in which to fry our doughnuts?
Ought we not then to be very thankful to
the domestic animals for thus treating us so
kindly?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Preston never afterward thought of this little
trip without the warmest gratitude to Miss
Pike. He had dreaded meeting the family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>but she explained matters to them so charmingly
that nobody thought of laughing at him.
And then the handsome Rover was such a
surprise and so generally admired that the
mishaps of the day, dreadful as they had been
at the time, seemed hardly worth mentioning
now.</p>

<p>"So you've been adopted by a dog, my
son," said Dr. Gray.</p>

<p>"How nice it was that you stopped at
Bremen!" said Julia. "I suppose you really
saved poor Rover's life. But then if it hadn't
been just you, he wouldn't have 'adopted'
you. You make dogs love you by just looking
at them."</p>

<p>"And I don't wonder," thought Miss
Pike.</p>

<p>Until to-day she had never seen any of the
Gray family except Mrs. Gray and Flaxie, but
now, as she gazed about the room, she perceived
at once that it was a most delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
home. Mrs. Gray was a pretty, black-eyed
woman, who seldom sat still many minutes
at a time except when the children were
safely asleep. Dr. Gray was a large, cheerful,
agreeable man, fond of telling short stories.
Julia, almost a young lady, had a remarkably
sweet face, and it was a pleasure
to see what care she took of noisy Phil and
dainty little Ethel.</p>

<p>But loveliest of all was Madam Gray, the
little fairy grandmother, with her white hair,
white cap, white ribbons, and dear, benevolent
face. She sat peacefully knitting, in
her easy-chair, while everybody was talking
and laughing around her; and Miss Pike
fancied she was thinking of the friends of
her youth, for something in her calm and
quiet face seemed to say,&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"They are all gone into a world of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I alone sit lingering here."<br /></span>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>"And long may you linger, you dear,
sweet, beautiful old lady," thought Miss
Pike, who knew, without being told, that
the whole family were better for blessed
Grandma Gray.</p>

<p>In a little more than two weeks Flaxie
returned from Hilltop, this time "all sole
alone," declaring she had had a "perfectly
lovely visit," that well repaid her for the
chicken-pox. She confided to her mother
that it was easy enough travelling alone, for
then you could keep your ticket and your
check, and were not burdened with any
troublesome crackers and cheese. But she
said nothing of this sort to Preston, for her
mother assured her it was wiser to drop the
subject. Mrs. Gray never approved of
teasing.</p>

<p>Miss Pike was gratified to see that Flaxie
had improved very much since the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
she went to school with the twin cousin,
Milly Allen, at Hilltop.</p>

<p>"The pure and gentle influences of her
home are moulding her into a fine little
girl. She is less rude, less forward, more
amiable, and thoughtful of others."</p>

<p>For her part, Flaxie told everybody that
Miss Pike was her "favorite friend," and it
made her "too happy for anything" to have
her in the house all the time.</p>

<p>Lessons were taught every morning in
the large pink chamber over the dining-room.
It was a school for the whole family,
from Julia, who learned French and painting,
down to tiny Ethel, who was allowed sometimes
to sit in the room and draw pictures
on the slate, or hold kitty in her lap, if she
wouldn't "'peak one word."</p>

<p>Yes, and often Rover came, too, the quietest
scholar of all, and perfectly happy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
crouch at his young master's feet and receive
a caressing pat now and then.</p>

<p>It was far more interesting than going
to the brick school-house, which was poorly
heated and not ventilated at all. Flaxie was
inclined to sore throats and Julia to headaches,
and it was for their sakes that Doctor
Papa had decided this winter to have a governess
in the house.</p>

<p>He could not have chosen a better one.
Miss Pike was an excellent young lady,
highly educated and refined. Moreover,
there was a peculiar charm about her, you
hardly knew what it was, though you could
not be with her five minutes without feeling
it.</p>

<p>Flaxie remembered how she used to go to
the white school-house at Hilltop with her
cousin Milly, and sit and admire Miss Pike,
and "wish she could see her soul," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Aunt Charlotte said was so much more
beautiful than her face. And now Flaxie
sat in an armed chair in the pink chamber
and admired her just the same. Somehow
there was a happy feeling all over the room
because Miss Pike was in it. Flaxie's
thoughts grew calm and pleasant, as if the
world were made of sunshine and flowers;
and she wished with all her heart to be truly
good and always growing better. She
hoped she should never do another wrong
thing as long as she lived.</p>

<p>But there was one drawback to this home
school, and that was Kittyleen. Did anything
ever happen at the village, particularly
at Dr. Gray's, that Kittyleen Garland did not
find it out sooner or later? No, indeed. It
was of no use trying to keep this little brown-eyed
maid away unless you locked the door.</p>

<p>"I can read some now. If I go to school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
I can read <i>all</i>," said Miss Kittyleen, coming
in all out of breath and peeping at the children
from between the rounds of a chair.</p>

<p>Then Flaxie had to take her down-stairs
to Mrs. Gray, who dropped her work to
amuse her.</p>

<p>Next day it would be the same thing over
again.</p>

<p>"Fought I'd come up and look out o'
your winner, Miss Pike.&mdash;There now, Effel,
draw a little baby on the slate, and I'll
say oh! oh!"</p>

<p>But Ethel, who had been taught to obey
orders, always shook her head sternly at
Kittyleen, whispering, "Effie don't 'peak a
word."</p>

<p>Miss Pike was never vexed with sweet
little wayward Kittyleen; but she did think
Mrs. Garland ought to keep her at home.
It was Flaxie whose temper was most tried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
for Flaxie was always the one to take the
young rogue down-stairs; and she found it
hard sometimes to refrain from shaking her
just a wee bit.</p>

<p>"What <i>made</i> you throw Ethel's kitty out
of the window?" she would say. "<i>You</i> are
the little girl that picked my dolly's eyes out.
O, Kittyleen, I made my will, and I <i>was</i>
going to give you the prettiest, cunningest
present; but if you don't stay at home I
shall make my will all over again, and not
give you one single thing."</p>

<p>Kittyleen had often heard of Flaxie's
"will," and had formed various opinions as
to what it might be. Sometimes she thought
it was a very large pin-cushion, sometimes
she thought it was a sort of Christmas box;
but she always cried when Flaxie said she
should "make it all over again," feeling that
this was more than she could bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Flatsie, please don't," she would plead,
with her little arms around her friend's neck.
"It's such a <i>pretty</i> will! Me velly much
obliged."</p>

<p>"Oh, you good-for-nothing, darling little
goosie. Let me kiss that snarl of hair.
Does your hair ache, Kittyleen, when it is
snarled?"</p>

<p>So the scolding generally ended in a kiss,
for let Baby Kittyleen do what she would,
Flaxie very well knew there was no guile in
her tiny heart.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, mamma, I'll ever grow
patient and good, like you and grammy and
Miss Pike?" asked Flaxie one night, in a
tone of deep discouragement. "I can't
keep my patience with Kittyleen when she
comes and rubs out my figures on the slate.
Why, mamma, I was real naughty to-day, I
<i>lost my calm</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you do try to be patient, dear, I know
you try," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, but I lost my calm,"
repeated the little girl dolefully. "I ought
not to. I ought to do unto Kittyleen as
I'd like to have other people do unto Ethel.
That's the Golden-Rule way, Julia says.
And should I like to have anybody whirl
Ethel round by the shoulders and call her a
<i>disgustable</i> girl?"</p>

<p>"She is a remarkably sweet child, my
daughter. She loves you in spite of everything."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, I love her, too, only I'd
love her better if she didn't always go
where she isn't wanted."</p>

<p>"Kittyleen goes <i>everywhere</i>," broke in little
Ethel, on a high key. "She goes to
church, Kittyleen does. Mayn't I go to
church, I won't 'peak a word."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, mamma, do let her," said Flaxie,
forgetting her late distress of mind, and
taking up a new subject. "She'd behave
ever so much better than Kittyleen; and
she has a new bonnet, too."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it does Kittyleen any
good to go to church?" asked Mrs. Gray,
smiling.</p>

<p>"No'm, but it would do Ethel good, for
she'd sit still and hear every word like a
little lady."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> hear every word, Mary?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o, mamma, not always, but I mean
to. And Ethel has such a pretty bonnet."</p>

<p>"Please, mamma," echoed the little one
eagerly, "such a pretty bonnet. And I
won't 'peak a word."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Gray, kissing baby's
cherry lips. "Perhaps we'll let the <i>bonnet</i>
go to church; we will see."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<small><small>FLAXIE IN CHURCH.</small></small></h2>



<p>The little one went to church the very
next Sunday, and though sister "Ninny"
had her in charge, Flaxie felt that she could
not drop her off her own mind for a moment.
So charming was wee Ethel in her blue silk
bonnet, with a lace frill about the face, that
Flaxie was obliged to turn half around and
gaze at her, completely lost in admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's the sweetest, best little dear!
Ninny needn't say she isn't as pretty as Kittyleen,
for she certainly is! Anyway, her <i>bonnet</i>
is just as pretty, and a great deal newer!
Now there's Fanny Townsend's little sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
I should think Fanny'd be ashamed to have
her wear such a bonnet."</p>

<p>Good Mr. Lee was preaching a sermon,
which he thought the children in the congregation
could nearly all understand; but the
words seemed to Flaxie to run together
without any meaning; she was not trying to
listen.</p>

<p>"How Kittyleen does nestle about! Her
mother doesn't watch her a bit. She lets
her do everything and go everywhere. I
think she's a queer woman. My mamma
wouldn't let Ethel stir out of the house if
she couldn't behave better than Kittyleen.
No, she'd tie her in a chair.</p>

<p>"Why, there's Sadie Stockwell sitting with
Aunty Prim. That's my dress Sadie has
on. Pity Sadie's father can't buy her any
dresses! Pity he drinks so, and is so poor!
Pity Sadie is so lame, with her shoulders all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
hitched up! How kind of Miss Pike, to give
Sadie that beautiful book! When I grow up
I'm going to be just like Miss Pike and
make people love me. Perhaps I can be
good if I'm <i>not</i> very homely."</p>

<p>Here Flaxie stole another glance at Ethel's
bonnet. "Darling! She's just as still as a
lady. I suppose she's saying to herself,
'Effel won't 'peak a word.' What if she
<i>should</i> speak! Just think! I wonder if Mr.
Lee knows she's at church? He loves
Ethel, for he sent her a little box of honey.
I shouldn't think he'd like to keep bees. I
should think he'd be afraid they'd sting his
little boy.&mdash;There, I must look up at Mr.
Lee and hear what he says."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to the pulpit. "How
queer his head looks where the hair is so
bald! The top of it is just as smooth and
white! Why, it shines like the ivory ball on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Ninny's parasol. What did make Mr. Lee's
hair all go off? Doctor Papa said <i>he</i> didn't
know what made it go off, for Mr. Lee isn't
old a bit, he's almost young." Gazing at the
smooth, ivory-white top of the minister's
head naturally reminded the little girl of
something Phil had said not long ago when
his hair was to be cut.</p>

<p>"Please don't cut it <i>very</i> short," said little
Phil, "don't cut it as short as Mr. Lee's."</p>

<p>Flaxie was in great danger of smiling as
she recollected this.</p>

<p>"Why don't I listen to the sermon?"
thought she. "It's very wicked not to
listen. Oh, he's gone way by the text! What
is he saying about the brook of Cherith?
They don't have Bible places in my geography,
and I never heard of the brook of
Cherith."</p>

<p>Next moment, after a fond glance at Ethel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
her eye fell upon Preston, and this gave still
another turn to her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I should think Preston would be ashamed
ever to say anything more to me about my
'Domestic Animals.' The composition he
wrote the other day is ever so much worse
than that."</p>

<p>It was "The Story of Evangeline." Miss
Pike had read Longfellow's beautiful poem
aloud, and then asked the children to write
down all they could remember of it.</p>

<p>Here, in Preston's own words, is</p>


<p class="p11"><big>THE STORY OF EVANGELINE.</big></p>

<p>"Evangeline lived in Nova Scotia. She was
engaged to Gabriel. He was a blacksmith's
son. The English soldiers came and told the
French to leave. They left. Evangeline and
Gabriel did not go on the same boat. They
got mixed up and separated. Evangeline did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
not like it. She and her priest went all
round out West to try to find Gabriel. He
did not try to find <i>her</i>. Then she heard he
had gone up North to trade for mules, and
she went to hunt him up. She did not find
him. Then she grew very old and went to
live with the Quakers. She was a nun. One
Sunday morning she picked some flowers
and went to the poor-house, and found an
old man in bed dying. She said, Gabriel.
He looked up. They kissed each other and
he died."</p>

<p>Dr. Gray said this story ought to be entitled
"The Fatal Effects of a Kiss." Even
grandma had laughed heartily on reading it,
though Preston himself could see nothing in
it to laugh at.</p>

<p>But it was by no means of Evangeline or
her fatal kiss that Preston was thinking just
now. Sitting quietly beside his father, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was looking up at the minister and drinking
in every word of the sermon. He had long
been noted for his excellent behavior at
church, and Mr. Lee had more than once
said to the boy's father that none of the
grown people listened to their pastor with
more respectful attention than young Preston
Gray. I am afraid Mr. Lee would not
have said anything like that about Flaxie.
She sat still enough, often very still indeed,
but her eyes were roving all about, and so
were her thoughts.</p>

<p>Miss Pike observed this, and it occurred to
her that it would be a very sad thing if Flaxie
should allow her inattention to grow into a
confirmed habit. Very likely she said something
of the sort to Dr. Gray, for she felt a
great interest in the child's improvement.
At any rate, that afternoon, when the four
o'clock dinner was over and the Gray family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
were seated in the back parlor,&mdash;Miss Pike,
grandma, and all,&mdash;Doctor Papa said, rather
unexpectedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now suppose we ask these little people
what the sermon was about this morning?"</p>

<p>He chanced to be looking at Flaxie as he
spoke, but she said quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, please ask Julia first, papa, for she
is the oldest. No, I mean Ethel, for she is
the youngest."</p>

<p>This was too absurd.</p>

<p>"Isn't <i>Phil</i> young enough? Perhaps we
may begin with him. Think hard, my son,
and see if you can remember anything Mr.
Lee said to-day."</p>

<p>Little Phil knitted his brows, but like
Flaxie he had been looking around, not listening.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, there was a woman there, had
a thing on all bangled with beads."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my son; but what did the minister
say?" Phil rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was a little girl there, about as
big as Ethel, had a white bonnet on and a
white cloak."</p>

<p>"Yes; but what did the minister say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ethel," said crestfallen little Phil,
turning to his baby sister for comfort, "you
and I are too small. We can't remember
what they preach, can we?"</p>

<p>"We won't be too hard on you, my little
son," said Doctor Papa. "You are only five
years old; but I am sure Mr. Lee says some
things that even you can understand. Will
you really try next Sunday to listen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how, papa," replied the
little fellow, dropping his head.</p>

<p>"But I only asked you to try. You can
try, can't you, Philip? Now, next Sunday
afternoon there will be a particularly large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
yellow banana in the fruit-dish at dessert, and
it will go to the small boy who can tell me
something&mdash;just a little something&mdash;the
minister said."</p>

<p>Phil's eyes began to shine. Oh, wouldn't
he look straight at Mr. Lee next Sunday, and
bring home lots and lots of the sermon!</p>

<p>"There, it's Flaxie's turn now," said he,
as Flaxie with a very sober face wedged her
chair between her mother and Miss Pike.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lee said," began she, hurriedly, "he
said something about a brook,&mdash;I forget the
name of the brook,&mdash;and he said something
about a man,&mdash;I can't think what the man's
name was,&mdash;and the ravens came and fed
him."</p>

<p>"The ravens are right. Go on. Why did
the ravens feed him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, papa." Flaxie looked helpless.
"I didn't hear the rest. I had to
watch Ethel for fear she'd talk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Gray said nothing more. He merely
looked at his little daughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I won't do so again. I won't,
truly. I'll hear every single word. But
sometimes, you know, I can't understand."</p>

<p>"You could have understood this, my
daughter; it was all very simple. Now,
Preston?"</p>

<p>"It was about the prophet Elijah, sir.
Elijah was a very solemn kind of man. He
lived alone in the mountains and talked with
God. There was a wicked king called Ahab,
who worshipped idols, and Elijah went to
him and told him it was wrong, and Ahab
was very angry, and Elijah had to run away.
He was told to go to the brook Cherith and
drink the waters of it, and the ravens would
come and feed him. And the ravens did.
They brought him bread and meat night and
morning till the brook dried up and Elijah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
had to go somewhere else. I believe," said
Preston, reflecting, "I believe that's all I
can remember."</p>

<p>"You have done well. Do you know to
what nation Elijah belonged?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Can Julia tell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he was an Arab." Julia always
looked very modest and pretty in answering
questions. She went on now, with her hands
folded in her lap. "Elijah had long thick
hair hanging down his back, and he wore a
cape of sheepskin; they called it a mantle.
And he used to hide his face in it sometimes,
and sometimes he rolled it up and used it for
a staff."</p>

<p>"What is a raven?"</p>

<p>"It is a kind of crow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it was a kind of ostrich,"
said Flaxie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>This extraordinary statement brought a
smile to Preston's face, but his father said,
"I was just thinking of a little story about
an ostrich. God has strange ways of saving
people's lives sometimes."</p>

<p>The children looked attentive, and Mrs.
Gray drew Ethel into her lap to keep her
quiet, while papa pared his orange and began:</p>

<p>"It was more than fifty years ago that Mr.
Broadbent, a missionary, was travelling in
Cape Colony. Where is that, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Africa, Africa; way down there at
the bottom of the map."</p>

<p>"He had his family with him, and a few
friends and some Hottentots. There were
fourteen in the party. They were crossing a
sandy table-land. What is that, Julia?"</p>

<p>"High and flat land, like a table."</p>

<p>"Right. They rode in wagons, drawn by
oxen. It was a week's journey, but they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
not enough food to start with, and could buy
but little at the last town on the way. So
after they had travelled two days there was
not much left but a small sack of rice and
some tea and coffee. What would become
of them? Five more days across a country
where nothing grew, not even a blade of
grass! Now and then they saw a bird flying
overhead, but it was very swift, and
far away, and they could hardly ever hit it
with their guns."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, did they starve?" asked Flaxie.</p>

<p>"There, now, if those birds had only been
ravens!"</p>

<p>"The party stopped to rest, and they sent
one of the Hottentots to watch the oxen;
but I dare say he fell asleep, for several of
the oxen strayed away.</p>

<p>"It seemed a great pity, for he had to
go to look them up and was gone a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
time, and the travellers could not afford to
wait."</p>

<p>"Well, if they were going to starve, papa,
it didn't make any difference whether they
waited or not."</p>

<p>"When the Hottentot came back he had
a great piece of news to tell. He had found
the nest of an ostrich, with forty eggs in it."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, are ostrich eggs good to eat?
Do tell us about it."</p>

<p>"So I will, my daughter, if I am not interrupted
too often."</p>

<p>Flaxie blushed, and hid her face on Miss
Pike's shoulder.</p>

<p>"The nest of an ostrich is a curiosity, and
Mr. Broadbent waded through two or three
miles of deep sand to see this one. You
would think the mother bird had studied
arithmetic all her life, for she seemed to have
counted the eggs and set them in their places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>with perfect exactness. In the middle were
fourteen close together, and three or four
feet away from them were the other twenty-six
eggs in an unbroken circle, as even as a
row of gold beads.</p>

<p>"The ostrich had been sitting on the ones
in the middle. She expected to hatch just
fourteen birds. She had not sat on the outer
eggs at all, and there they were, entirely
fresh and good to eat. She was saving them
as food for the babies. She meant to break
them, one after another, and give them to her
chickens as fast as they should come out of
the shell.</p>

<p>"It would be just as much food as the fourteen
little ones would need, before they were
old enough to go abroad with her and pick
up their living in the desert. How do you
suppose the ostrich knew this? She had
hardly any brain, a very stupid bird indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>It must have been taught her directly from
Heaven.</p>

<p>"Well, you see now that the travellers did
not starve. For a meal they broke one of
these eggs into a bowl, beat it well, and
mixed with it a little flour, pepper, and salt,
and fried it in a pan. It served very well instead
of bread with their tea and coffee, and
when they arrived at their station they had
two or three eggs to spare."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Preston, as his father
paused and offered a piece of orange to Ethel.
"It was almost as good as the ravens, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"I want to ask one question," said Julia.
"How large is an ostrich egg?"</p>

<p>"It weighs perhaps three pounds, and is
almost as large around the middle as Ethel's
waist."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad those people didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
starve," remarked Flaxie, "I was afraid one
while they would."</p>

<p>I have introduced this true story here,
partly for its own sake, and partly to give
you a picture of one of the delightful Sunday
afternoons at Dr. Gray's. If I had time I
would like to tell you of the strong efforts
which Flaxie made from this very day to
overcome the bad habit of letting her
thoughts wander in church. But this book
is so small, and there are yet so many events
waiting to be described, that I must now
hasten on to something else.</p>

<p>In April Miss Pike went home, carrying
with her the hearts of all the Grays, both
young and old. The whole family insisted
so strongly upon her coming back the next
winter that she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you; perhaps I may come, for I
have been very happy at Laurel Grove, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
love every one of you dearly. But," she
added, smiling, "you forget that you may not
be here next winter. If Dr. Gray should be
elected to Congress, won't you all go to
Washington?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he does not expect to be elected,"
replied Mrs. Gray. "But if we <i>should</i> go to
Washington, we shall want you to go there
with us. Now, please remember."</p>

<p>"How delightful! Well, Mrs. Gray, I will
say to you as you say to little Ethel, '<i>We
will see</i>.'"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<small><small>PRIMROSE BOWER.</small></small></h2>




<p>Flaxie did not hear this conversation,
or she would have built various castles in
the air in regard to "going to Congress." It
is true, people often talked before her of the
coming "election," and spoke of Dr. Gray as
a "candidate;" but the words were mysterious,
and soon faded out of her mind.</p>

<p>The snow and mud had disappeared.
Dandelions were shining everywhere in the
tender grass, and Ethel said, gleefully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, see the <i>dandy-diddles</i>!"</p>

<p>The birds burst forth into song and the
trees into leaves. Flaxie pointed to the soft,
fresh leaf-buds slowly unfolding, and said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>her mother, "Miss Pike calls them the beautiful
thoughts the trees have kept all winter
shut up in their hearts. Miss Pike is so
funny!"</p>

<p>Summer came, and by the last of June
Grandpa and Grandma Curtis and Grandma
Hyde arrived from Kentucky. This made
three grandmothers in the house at one time.
The Gray family were remarkably rich in
grandmothers; and there was still another,
a fourth one, who might have come if she
had not been too feeble, and that was dear
Grandma Pressy.</p>

<p>The two from Kentucky were entirely
unlike, yet each in her way was excellent and
charming,&mdash;tall, queenly Grandma Hyde,
wearing gray silk and a turban, and always
piecing together a silk patch-work quilt;
roly-poly Grandma Curtis, clad entirely in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>black, and always knitting children's stockings
with needles that clicked. But they
were alike in one respect; they both remembered
everything they had ever seen or
heard of, and everything that had ever happened
since the world began. Yes, and
they were both gifted with wondrous powers
of story-telling. Tiny Grandma Gray, with
her sweet, low voice, had hardly a chance to
speak; for the Kentucky ladies were talking
morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p>It was delightful to hear them, and
Grandma Gray listened and laughed, her
white cap-strings fluttering, and said she
was renewing her youth. But by-and-by it
began to tire her head, for she was very
delicate indeed, and she complained that she
could not sleep. Still she <i>would</i> stay in the
parlor, she enjoyed the talking so much; and
Mrs. Prim came one day, and declared she
should carry her off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must stay with me a while and be
quiet," said Mrs. Prim, who liked to manage
everything, "and Mary shall come with
you to take care of you."</p>

<p>Flaxie did not spring up and exclaim, "Oh,
Auntie Prim, thank you, thank you, I'd be
so glad to go!" for the truth was she did not
wish to go in the least. At the same time,
she felt it a high honor to be invited to Mrs.
Prim's to take care of Grandma Gray. She
could remember the time, not so very long
ago, when she had been sent away from
home because Grandma Gray could not bear
the noise she made.</p>

<p>"I'm growing a great deal stiller and a
great deal better as I grow up," thought the
little girl, with a throb of pride, "but I didn't
suppose Auntie Prim knew it."</p>

<p>"We don't like to spare our dear little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Mary," said both the Kentucky grandmothers
in a breath; and then Flaxie felt
prouder than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, she can come home every day to see
you, and you will be surprised at the number
of pillow-cases she will make; she always
sews very steadily at my house," replied
Mrs. Prim. "Run now, Mary, and get your
hat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim had the finest house and
grounds in Laurel Grove, but it was very
still there, oh, altogether too still! The gardener
never talked, except to himself, the
chambermaid was rather deaf, and Kitty, the
cook, did not like any one in her nice, orderly
kitchen. Flaxie thought it a very dull place,
except at the hours when Mr. Prim came
home to his meals.</p>

<p>One day she sat in the parlor, sewing
"over and over" upon a pillow-case. Out of
doors it was a lovely June day. The trees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
grass, and birds, and flowers, were nodding
at one another, and having a gay time, and
Flaxie longed to be with them. But no, at
"Primrose Bower," as Mr. Prim called his
home, it was necessary to stay in the house;
for Auntie Prim thought a little girl nine
years old ought to "sew her seams," and
<i>then</i> she might play, perhaps, if she found
any time.</p>

<p>Strange there shouldn't be any dog at
Primrose Bower, or even a cat; but Grandma
Gray was there, and that was a comfort.
The more Flaxie waited upon the silver-haired,
sweet-voiced, fairy grandmother, the
better she loved her; only dear Grandma
Gray was always going to sleep on the sofa,
and then you had to keep still enough to
hear a pin drop for fear of waking her up.</p>

<p>"Well," said Auntie Prim, coming into
the parlor with her bonnet on, "I gave you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
work enough to last a good while, didn't I,
Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm, ever so long," replied Flaxie,
with a sorrowful glance at the pillow-case.</p>

<p>"So you won't mind staying in the house
with grandma, will you? I'm going to the
stores to buy a calico dress and various
things; but when I come back you may run
home, and stay as long as you like."</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm," said Flaxie, meekly.</p>

<p>She thought Auntie Prim spent a good
deal of time at the stores, and was afraid if
she bought "various things" it would be
pretty late by the time she came back; and
Flaxie did want to ask Grandma Curtis a few
questions about Venus, the colored girl who
lived at her house in Kentucky, and she
wanted a ride before dark on Preston's pony.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Auntie Prim, thoughtfully,
"perhaps it would be better for you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>to promise me not to leave this room while
I'm gone. You mean well, Mary, but
you're <i>so</i> fond of running! Yes, on account
of Grandma Gray, I think I should
feel easier if you were to make me a
promise."</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm, I will promise! I'll stay right
here. I'll not go out of this room," replied
Flaxie, so sweetly that Mrs. Prim never
suspected the child's sensitive pride was
wounded.</p>

<p>"She thinks I'm a horrid little girl. She
thinks I'm just awful," said Flaxie to herself,
as she looked out of the window and
watched her aunt walking away with a gray-fringed
parasol in one hand and a shopping-bag
in the other. "My mamma would have
trusted me without any promise! She'd
<i>know</i> I wouldn't run off and leave Grandma
Gray!" Very soon Grandma Gray came in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>and said she was going to <i>try</i> to get a nap on
the sofa, and hoped Flaxie would keep pretty
still. "Yes, 'm," sighed Flaxie; and after
this she breathed as softly as possible for
fear of making a noise.</p>

<p>Grandma was asleep in two minutes, with
her handkerchief over her eyes, and that
made the room seem more lonesome than
ever. Outside a stray cat came and sat on
the window-sill, begging to come in; and as
she opened her mouth to mew, she looked,
Flaxie thought, like a wee, wee old lady,
whose little teeth were more than half gone.
Flaxie loved cats; why not let her in?</p>

<p><i>But no!</i> The window had a fly-screen, and
besides, Auntie Prim didn't approve of cats.
"It's <i>no, no, no</i>, all the time. I don't like
Primrose Bower," thought poor Flaxie, dropping
her work and stealing on tiptoe to the
mantel, to smell the flowers in the bronze vase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>They were lovely roses and lilies, but they
looked as if they longed to be out of doors,
where they could bend their tired heads.
The chairs seemed rather uncomfortable, too,
standing up so stiff and straight against the
gilded walls. Even the gilded fireboard
looked as if it was set in the fireplace very
hard, and had no hope of ever coming out.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so still here, and so shut up! I
wish there was something alive in the room,"
thought the little sewing-girl, going back to
her task.</p>

<p>She did not know that close behind her
there <i>was</i> something alive&mdash;dreadfully alive&mdash;a
cross, disappointed, hungry bee! How
had he got there, into that shut-up room
where even the little flies never dared come?</p>

<p>But there he was, and he would not go
away without doing mischief. Perhaps he
had had some family trouble, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
soured his temper; or perhaps he mistook
Flaxie for a new variety of blush rose, of
great size and sweetness. At any rate, he
flew straight toward her, and without the
least ceremony stung her on the wrist.
Poor Flaxie! Was it not rather severe?
Particularly as she dared not scream. "I
must scream, I will scream," she thought in
agony; "I will, I will!"</p>

<p><i>But no.</i> For grandma was fast asleep.
She must not wake grandma, though the sky
should fall.</p>

<p>"I'll run out-doors. I'll run home to
mamma. I <i>must</i> go where I can scream."</p>

<p><i>But no!</i> She couldn't even go into the
entry. Hadn't she promised? And you
must know Flaxie belonged to the sort of
little girls who hold a promise to be as
sacred as the oath of a queen.</p>

<p>So she stayed where she was, and bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
anguish in silence. She could not possibly
help hopping up and down, but she hopped
softly; she could not help groaning, but
she groaned in whispers; she could not keep
the tears back, but she sobbed them noiselessly
into her handkerchief. I don't know
what you think of this, little reader, but I
think it was truly grand and heroic.</p>

<p>Are you nine years old, and have you ever
borne the sting of a bee, or the drawing of
a tooth, without uttering a sound? Ah, you
have! Then I would like to see you, and
shake hands!</p>

<p>Grandma Gray woke presently, and saw
Flaxie shaking with sobs, her head buried
in the cushion of Uncle Prim's chair. You
may be sure she was not long in learning
what the matter was, and in calling Kitty
from the kitchen to bathe the poor puffed
wrist with arnica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, thin, and a bee always knows what is
swate," said Irish Kate, bathing the wrist
softly.</p>

<p>"The blessed little darling!" murmured
grandma, not referring, of course, to the bee.
"To think you shouldn't have made one bit
of noise to disturb your grandmother! I
wouldn't have blamed you if you'd screamed
with all your might."</p>

<p>"But, grandma, I promised you I wouldn't
make a noise."</p>

<p>"So you did, precious child. I forgot
that."</p>

<p>"And I promised Auntie Prim I'd stay in
this room. Oh, how I did want to go out and
scream!"</p>

<p>"Little Mary," said gentle Grandma Gray,
taking Flaxie in her arms, "I'm proud of
you, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Ah, wasn't it worth all Flaxie had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
suffered to hear such words as these?
When had anybody been proud of her
before?"</p>

<p>The pain was over, but the little wrist was
still "a sight to behold" when Auntie
Prim came home with her calico dress and
"various things" in her bag; and grandma
said, in a ringing voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Prim, we have a little girl here who
is quite a heroine. Yes, a heroine, I say!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean our little Mary? Why,
what has she done?" asked auntie, coolly, as
she put away her bonnet and parasol. But
she wasn't quite so cool after she had heard
the story.</p>

<p>"Why, you good, high-minded little girl!
A grown woman couldn't have been braver,"
said she, and actually kissed Flaxie.</p>

<p>"It is a great pity I bound you by a promise;
I needn't have done it. Some little girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
can be trusted without any promises," she
added, looking at grandma with an approving
smile.</p>

<p>Flaxie blushed for joy. She had always
had a vague feeling of being looked down
upon by Auntie Prim, as a wild little girl
who was "<i>so</i> fond of running"; and now to
have this stern, good woman praise her so!</p>

<p>"But," said auntie, unrolling the dotted
brown calico and laying it across her lap,
"how came that bee in <i>here</i>, with the doors
shut and the fly-screens all in?"</p>

<p>As she spoke, <i>two</i> bees buzzed and circled
slowly above her head. In her surprise I
must confess Mrs. Prim screamed. Flaxie
was delighted. Mrs. Prim, however, was a
little ashamed, for the minister, Mr. Lee, at
that moment entered the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, what's this?" said he, laughing;
"are you hiding away my bees?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> bees?" cried Mrs. Prim; and she
looked up at Mr. Lee, who stood, hat in
hand, his bald head shining, as Flaxie had
once fancied, like the ivory ball on Julia's
parasol.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, <i>my</i> bees! They swarmed
this afternoon, and your gardener told me he
suspected some of them had come down here,
and settled in your chimney. He saw them
flying over the roof of the house."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim was a good woman, and had a
high respect for her pastor. It seemed very
strange and very improper that she should
set a trap for his bees; but she laughed, and
they all laughed, and she said Stillwater, the
gardener, should go out on the roof through
the sky-window, and look down the parlor
chimney, and see what was going on inside.</p>

<p>Stillwater did so, and reported that a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
family of bees had begun housekeeping in
the chimney.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Prim, who came in just
then, "and they are making themselves
too much at home altogether! Why, they
think they have a right not only to the chimney,
but to the whole parlor, and mean to
creep out around the edges of the fireboard,
and peep at us whenever they choose.</p>

<p>"But they needn't have stung my good
little Mary, and they must not sting her
again," said Mr. Lee, patting her head. He
had been very much pleased of late by
Flaxie's attentive behavior at church; and he
thought now, as he looked at her fine young
face, that she was improving faster in character
than any other little girl he knew in
Laurel Grove.</p>

<p>And to prevent further mischief from the
bees, the fireboard was fastened in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
firmly. Uncle Prim did this with little wads
of gilt paper; and even Auntie Prim, who was
so particular, declared no one could have
made it look better.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like my beehive, ladies,"
said Uncle Prim, with a low bow. "And
now I hope the bees will do their duty, and
fill it with the very nicest honey, from the
very sweetest flowers that grow in Primrose
garden; and Mr. Lee is heartily welcome to
every drop!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," returned Mr. Lee, "but
if the honey is going to belong to me, I shall
take pleasure in presenting it to little Mary.
She has well earned it by being such a martyr
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Flaxie had no clear idea what a martyr
meant, but was sure from Mr. Lee's tone it
must be something he approved. Therefore,
she ran home in the finest spirits, to relate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>the stirring events of the afternoon to her
family, and the two admiring grandmothers.</p>

<p>"And mamma," asked she, as soon as she
saw her mother alone, "may I give the
honey to Sadie Stockwell next Christmas?
Let me go my own self, please, with Blackdrop
and the little sleigh, and carry it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, my dear. But it is quite
uncertain where you will be next Christmas,"
replied Mrs. Gray, who had strong reason to
think she might be in Washington.</p>

<p>Flaxie, however, had forgotten all about
Washington. "Oh, perhaps I'm going to
Hilltop," thought she. "But that wouldn't
be quite so splendid as to have Milly come
to my house. If she can come to my
house next winter, and go to school to Miss
Pike in the pink chamber, I'll be perfectly
happy."</p>

<p>The little girl's dreams that night were of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>going to some wonderful country she had
never seen before. It must have been somewhere
in fairyland, for</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<small><small>THE LAST FEATHER.</small></small></h2>



<p>Things happen to us sometimes that are
even better than we have dreamed. To be
with Miss Pike in the pink chamber again
had seemed happiness to Flaxie; but to be
with Miss Pike in Washington, going everywhere
and seeing everything, this was bliss
indeed!</p>

<p>Dr. Gray was elected to Congress; Preston
was sent to boarding-school; Julia stayed
with Grandma Gray at Mrs. Prim's; and
Mrs. Gray went with her husband and the
three youngest children to board in Washington
for the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Flaxie had never before seen so beautiful
a city, though she had travelled much more
than ordinary girls of her age. For days she
never tired of looking down from the window
of her fourth-story room, upon the clean,
white avenue, and watching the horses, carriages,
and people passing to and fro. High,
high above the heads of the people was a
network of telegraph wires glistening in the
sun, and Flaxie thought if the wires would
only go higher yet, and bind the stars and
the earth together, how grand it would be.
She called this chamber her "sky-room," and
shared it with her "favorite friend," Miss
Pike. At the same hotel were Mrs. Garland
and Kittyleen, and Kittyleen's cousin Cora,
a girl of Flaxie's own age. Truly, as little
Ethel had said, Kittyleen did "go everywhere";
but who would have thought of her
following the Grays to Washington? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
then, this was Mrs. Garland's native city,
and she had come here to spend part of the
winter, and take lessons in painting.</p>

<p>Kittyleen was just as pretty, and dear, and
sweet, as ever,&mdash;and just as troublesome.
Her room was next Miss Pike's, and of
course Miss Pike or Flaxie could not stir
without her following them, for Kittyleen
adored Flaxie; and besides, her mamma was
always busy painting.</p>

<p>She followed them to the Capitol, when
they went to look at the statues and pictures;
she followed them to the stores, when
they went shopping. Little Ethel never
cared to go anywhere without her mother,
and Phil had some larger boys for playmates;
but Kittyleen felt that <i>she</i> belonged
to <i>Flaxie</i>. Mrs. Garland laughed, and said
she ought to be tied to Flaxie's side by a
blue ribbon, like a little Skye terrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>And here I think I must tell you how
Kittyleen went to the White House to the
President's reception, where she was as
much out of place as a humming-bird in a
flock of crows. But it was not the child's
fault. Her mother was very thoughtless, or
she would not have asked Miss Pike to take
her; and Miss Pike had no idea what she was
doing, or she would not have consented.</p>

<p>But first I shall be obliged to speak of
Flaxie's vanity. You may have observed
long ago that she was fond of looking in the
glass; and I regret to say the habit still continued.
In most respects she was constantly
improving; but Doctor Papa said he really
feared the nice new clothes she wore at
Washington had a bad effect upon her
mind. The strange ladies at the hotel sometimes
said in her hearing as she passed by,
"Who is that pretty little girl? Isn't she
lovely?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>This was unfortunate; for now she never
went anywhere, and saw people looking at
her, but she fancied they were thinking,
"Isn't she lovely?" And on the Saturday
afternoon when she was going to the President's
reception she wished to look as pretty
as possible, so that the people at the White
House, and perhaps the President himself,
might admire her.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said she, "may I wear my
crushed-strawberry dress, and my long-button
gloves, and my bonnet with the red bird?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear, they are quite unsuitable.
I am very sorry now that I promised to take
you at all, for I'm afraid there will be a great
crowd."</p>

<p>"But I never saw the President, mamma,
and I like a great crowd. And I'll be <i>so</i>
careful of my best bonnet!" pleaded Flaxie
in a whining tone, very irritating to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
mother, who was dressing in haste. It
sounded like the troublesome teasing Flaxie
of two or three years ago.</p>

<p>"My little daughter," said Mrs. Gray,
pausing as she pinned her collar, "you
cannot believe that I know better than you
do how you should dress? Very well, I will
allow you to wear your best bonnet on this
condition: If that scarlet bird gets broken,
you are not to have another bird this winter,
no, nor even a feather!"</p>

<p>Flaxie hesitated. Much as she wished to
look "lovely," she did not like to do anything
her mamma disapproved. Still, how
<i>could</i> she hurt her bonnet, just wearing it to
a party?</p>

<p>"Make haste, child, here are Miss Pike
and Kittyleen," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>And the little girl finally laid aside her
every-day hat she had been holding in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
hand, put on her best bonnet with a blushing,
downcast face, and walked slowly behind her
mother. Little Ethel threw kisses after
them, though quite disturbed in her small
mind because "Kittyleen went everywhere,"
while she and Phil had to stay with Mrs.
Fry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray and Miss Pike did not consider
what a foolish thing they were doing, till they
walked up the gravel path to the White
House, and saw the long line of carriages.</p>

<p>"This is no place for children; it is a great
crowd," said Mrs. Gray, nervously.</p>

<p>Mounting the front steps, they saw seated
on one side of the large entrance hall a band
of musicians, all in uniform, playing bugles,
fifes, cornets, and drums. There were no
children to be seen, and none of the vast
number of people who had entered, or were
entering the hall, seemed to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
slightest notice of Flaxie's beautiful clothes.
They all stood in a line, three or four abreast,
and if they could be said to be looking at
anything it was at the beautiful windows
straight before them,&mdash;not glass windows,
the panes were lovely gems of various shapes
and sizes, and nearly all the colors of the
rainbow; and of course you could not look
through them into the White House.</p>

<p>"Keep fast hold of my hand, Mary," said
Mrs. Gray. "The people are crowding in
behind us."</p>

<p>"Keep fast hold of my hand, Kittyleen,"
said Miss Pike, "or I shall lose you."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked little Kittyleen,
who might have been going up in a
balloon for all she knew to the contrary.</p>

<p>"We are trying to go through a door, but
you can't see the door, there are so many
people ahead of us."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, when we come to the door and get
through it, then we shall see the President,
sha'n't we?" said Flaxie. "But oh, dear, I
don't care so much about him as I did! It
takes so long, and the people push so."</p>

<p>By this time, the little party of four
were wedged in very tight. They could
not move one step, except as they were
pushed. Flaxie's crushed-strawberry dress
was crushed quite out of sight, and nothing
was to be seen of her but two bewildered
blue eyes, a tuft of flaxen hair, and&mdash;sad to
relate&mdash;a broken-winged bird of Paradise!</p>

<p>And where was little Kittyleen? By looking
down, down, among the ladies' cloaks and
skirts, Miss Pike could just espy the top
of the little girl's bonnet, and the end of her
nose.</p>

<p>"It isn't very comfortable, <i>is</i> it, Kittyleen?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>said Miss Pike, pitying, but not knowing
how to help her. "No'm, it isn't <i>very</i>
com-fi-a-ble," replied the darling, catching
her breath.</p>

<p>The crowd had been moving very, very
slowly, but now it stopped altogether.</p>

<p>"The people at the front, who got in first,
are halting to shake hands with the President,"
said a man in the crowd; "and we
must wait for them to move on."</p>

<p>They waited perhaps fifteen minutes; and
all the while the people behind could not
stand still, but kept pushing.</p>

<p>"Don't they know we <i>can't</i> move? Why
do they push?" grumbled Flaxie, indignantly.
"Do tell them to keep still,
mamma; tell the people behind to keep
still."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray only laughed.</p>

<p>"Mamma, they don't obey the Golden
Rule, or they wouldn't push so and hurt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Flaxie was always talking about the Golden
Rule.</p>

<p>"My daughter, we are here and must bear
it. Try to be brave and not cry."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I don't mean to cry; but
they squeeze so hard that they squeeze the
tears right out of my eyes. I just know I
shall die!"</p>

<p>Flaxie's wail was piteous, indeed; but it
was little Kittyleen&mdash;ever so much shorter
and younger and frailer; dear, patient Kittyleen&mdash;who
was in far more danger of being
hurt. She must have been almost suffocated
by this time, for absolutely nothing, not even
the crown of her bonnet, was to be seen. In
real alarm Miss Pike exclaimed, "How shall
I get this child up to give her some air?"</p>

<p>"What, a little child here? Can't you
lift her up, ma'am, and set her on my
shoulder?" said a gentleman just ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray and Miss Pike plunged down
for Kittyleen, and succeeded in drawing her
up from her dangerous hiding-place among
the cloaks and skirts, and setting her aloft
upon the kind stranger's shoulders. She
gave several little shuddering gasps, and her
eyes were full of tears; but when Miss Pike
asked, "Darling, how do you feel now?" she
answered, with a pathetic little smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel more com-fi-a-ble."</p>

<p>But Flaxie was still crying. It was not
only for the discomfort. She saw now what
a silly girl she had been to wear her best
clothes; and the broken wing of the bird
of Paradise dangling before her eyes added
the last feather to her weight of misery.</p>

<p>The crowd began to move again by half-inch
steps. The open door was reached at
last. Now they were fairly inside the White
House; yet still there was one room to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
cross, in order to reach the President. But
Flaxie's feelings were greatly changed. She
no longer expected the President to admire,
or even look at her. Why should he, so
forlorn and dilapidated as she was, and so
very, very small?</p>

<p>But she had little time for these humble
reflections. As they entered the door of the
White House a current of warm air met
them, and Mrs. Gray grew instantly faint.
A strange lady in the crowd caught a fan
from another strange lady, and gave it to
Miss Pike. Miss Pike fanned Mrs. Gray a
moment, and then she and some one else
dragged her out from the narrow line of
people who were pushing toward the next
room, and extended her upon the floor before
an open window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray was perfectly colorless, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>eyes were closed. "She has lost her consciousness,"
said some one, just as Flaxie
broke through the crowd and rushed toward
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, mamma, <i>are</i> you dead?
Speak to me, speak to me, mamma," wailed
the child.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Gray opened her eyes, and
smiled. She was obliged to smile in order
to reassure her little daughter, but she
was of course too weak yet to go back to
the dreadful crowd. She needed and must
have rest and quiet and fresh air.</p>

<p>"Children, do you care much about seeing
the President?" asked Miss Pike. "He
looks very much like other men; he doesn't
wear a crown."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>doesn't</i> wear a crown?" echoed little
Kittyleen. Perhaps she had fancied he did,
or, at any rate, that he was in some way a
very grand and radiant being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> don't want to see him,&mdash;not with
my things all torn off and looking like this,"
said Flaxie, in deep discouragement.</p>

<p>She was nearly as anxious to leave the
White House as she had been to enter it.
But when and how could they ever get out?</p>

<p>"Ladies," said a gentleman who had left
the crowd in disgust, and stood by the wall
with his arms folded,&mdash;"ladies, if you are
ill and want to go home, I can put you out
of the window. Will you allow me?"</p>

<p>It sounded very funny, and Miss Pike
laughed; but he was quite in earnest.
"Would you like to have me put you out,
madam? Here, mount this stool."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I would like it; but can you do
it, sir?" asked Miss Pike. "I'm pretty
heavy."</p>

<p>The polite gentleman answered by lifting
her up by the shoulders, so that she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
no trouble in climbing out of the low window,
and alighting upon the piazza.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir," said she. "Now I
will stand here, and help down the other lady
and the children."</p>

<p>This was easily managed; and soon all the
little party were safely drawing long breaths,
and laughing in the pure air outside; and
Miss Pike said, "Here we are at the back of
the house, and if the servants should spy us
they would take us for a set of tramps. But,
Mrs. Gray, I don't care for that, I'm so
very thankful to have got you and Kittyleen
out alive."</p>

<p>They hastened down the steps of the back
piazza, and got around to the front door, and
into the gravel path, and thence to the street,
as fast as possible.</p>

<p>When Doctor Papa came home to early
dinner, his wife related the adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"We made a great mistake in taking the
children," said she, "but dear little Kittyleen
was wonderfully patient and reasonable."</p>

<p>Flaxie twisted uneasily in her chair, feeling
that all praise of the little one was a
rebuke to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, Kittyleen was very good. I
don't see how she <i>could</i> be so good. But
you see I&mdash;why, I had a dreadful time. I
was so afraid about mamma. Why, I wasn't
sure when I saw her there on the floor that
she was really alive! She lay there as much
as ten minutes, I think, without any <i>conscience</i>
at all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not half a minute," laughed Mrs.
Gray. And then she laughed again as she
held up a fan, a pretty painted one with
ivory sticks. "I'm afraid the owner of this
fan will think I <i>never</i> had any conscience!
It was given to Miss Pike to fan me when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
I fainted, and we couldn't tell who gave it,
and so we had to bring it home."</p>

<p>"You might have left it with one of the
porters at the front door," said Doctor Papa.</p>

<p>"Oh, we never thought of that! What a
pity!"</p>

<p>As they were going down to dinner, Flaxie
saw her now ruined bird of Paradise lying in
the basket of rubbish, ready for Lena the
chambermaid to carry away. Her mother
had put it there without saying a word.
Flaxie knew she had lost her pretty bird and
could not have another one, "no, not even a
feather"; and though it seemed a hard punishment,
she felt that it was just.</p>

<p>A few days after this all the Grays and
Miss Pike, with Kittyleen and her cousin,
Cora Garland, went to Mount Vernon to see
the tomb and the old home of General Washington.
It was delightful; and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
spring, when Congress had risen and all
these gay times were only a memory, Flaxie
never tired of telling Grandma Gray how she
had played on the tiny piano that once
belonged to Lady Washington, and how
"just exactly" it had sounded like her own
doll's piano in the back parlor at home.</p>

<p>Grandma Gray listened kindly to these
reminiscences, and so indeed did all Flaxie's
playmates at Laurel Grove, though I wonder
they did not sometimes smile at the constant
refrain, "Last winter, when I was at
Washington." One little story, the adventures
of the runaway rings, you will find in
the next chapter, in Flaxie's own words, as
she related it to Grandma Gray.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<small><small>THE RUNAWAY RINGS.&mdash;FLAXIE'S STORY.</small></small></h2>




<p>"Oh, dear, the old man is out! Why,
grandma, don't you know what I mean? I
mean the rain-man! He always comes out
of that little weather-house on the mantel,
and looks around, you know, before it begins
to rain.</p>

<p>"And there, just see, it's pouring this
minute, and there are lots of people going
by with umbrellas. It makes me think of
that time last winter, when it rained so hard,
and I lost those rings. Do you want to hear
about it? Well, you just lie still and I'll
tell you, and we'll have a beautiful time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Isn't it a perfect state of bliss to think I've
got home, and can take care of you?</p>

<p>"But I did like to be at Washington. It
didn't seem like winter, with the rain a-raining,
and the sun a-shining, and no snow
hardly ever, and the streets as clean as a
floor.</p>

<p>"Besides, you know how I love Miss Pike;
she's my favorite friend. And a hotel is
splendid, there are so many children in it.
Only they're not all alike. Some are ever
so nice, and some <i>would</i> be nice if they
didn't have temper.</p>

<p>"Now, there was Cora Garland, Kittyleen's
cousin. She had a temper like this: see me
walk across the floor, grandma, with my head
thrown back,&mdash;so. <i>That</i> was the kind of
temper <i>she</i> had. But she didn't have it
very often, and she was good to Ethel and
Kittyleen and Phil. I liked Cora; I mean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>almost always I did. And I never saw a
girl with so many rings and earrings and
gold bracelets and things. Did you ever see
an honest, true diamond, grammy, hard
enough to scratch on the window-pane, and
bright enough to put your eyes out&mdash;almost?
Well, one of Cora's rings was a
diamond. I suppose it came out of a mine.
And one of her rings was red; I forget the
name of it; fiery, rosy red, and all of a
twinkle, with a row of pearls around it, like
little white currants.</p>

<p>"Well, I used to borrow Cora's rings and
bracelets sometimes, and she used to borrow
these old silver bangles. I don't see what
she wanted of <i>them</i>. You see they are just
bands of silver, with five-cent pieces dangling
down! But mamma didn't approve of my
wearing Cora's things.</p>

<p>"'Little Mary, I don't approve of borrowed
finery,' said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"So she wanted me to take them back.
And I always did take them back; but sometimes
I forgot, and borrowed them over again.
I don't remember now how I happened to
forget.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>thought</i> I wasn't telling the story
right. We lived up, up, up, away up on the
fourth floor! Did <i>you</i> ever go up in an
elevator? You wouldn't like it, but I did.
Our room was large and ever so pretty, with
two windows in it, where you could look
right out on the avenue. And there was a
fireman, who used to come in and fix the fire
in the grate.</p>

<p>"I slept with Miss Pike, and sometimes I
wouldn't wake in the morning till ever so
late, and she would go down to breakfast
without me. But she didn't care; she said
she didn't expect me to get up when I was
asleep, for how could I, you know? And by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and by she always came back and curled my
hair, and let me go down to breakfast with
Ethel and Kittyleen and Phil and Cora.</p>

<p>"But before I'd go down, and before Miss
Pike would come back, and while I'd be
asleep, the fireman would come in with his
bucket and fix the fire. I ought to tell about
this, so you'll understand better when I get
to the rings. You never knew whether there
was coal-dust on the fireman's face or not,
for he was always as black as could be, and
couldn't be any blacker. His name was
Lijar, just as if he came out of the Bible
and had been fed by ravens; but somehow
I didn't think he was very pious. No, I
seemed to think he was rather <i>un</i>-pious,
because he rolled his eyes around so much,
and kept laughing to himself.</p>

<p>"And there I'd be fast asleep on the bed;
but sometimes I'd just peep out under my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
eyelashes, and he'd be taking down some of
the pretty things from the mantel and looking
at them and laughing to himself. I
thought it was very impolite. He oughtn't
to have touched a single thing, now ought he,
with his hands so black and dirty? But I
never once thought of his stealing,&mdash;<i>not
then</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, one night, after I'd borrowed those
rings back again,&mdash;the diamond ring and the
red one with white currants round it,&mdash;I put
both the rings in a blue box, or I thought
I did, and set the box on the bureau right
under the looking-glass. And Lena stood at
the door and saw me.</p>

<p>"Why, I forgot to tell you about Lena!
She was the chambermaid, that went around
all day with a pink handkerchief tied on her
head, and a broom, and a pail. She was
French. She always walked into my room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
before I was up, same as Lijar did. And she
laughed, and shook the feather-duster at me
sometimes. I suppose she wished I wasn't
there on the bed, for she wanted to take off
the sheets. She didn't know how to talk
the American language very well, and I
didn't blame her; for of course French people
have to learn to talk, just like babies.
But she was a pretty girl, and I supposed she
was a great deal better than Lijar. She told
me one day she could say her prayers in
French, and so I never once thought of her
stealing,&mdash;<i>not then</i>.</p>

<p>"That night&mdash;the night I lost the rings&mdash;she
was there in the hall, and I was coming
along, waltzing a waltz. She set down her
broom and pail, and took those rings and put
them on her little finger. I let her do it.
And she said, 'Oh, <i>wee, wee</i>,' and kept smiling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<p>"I remember it was in the evening, and I
had just come up from playing in the public
parlor, and I had on my crushed-strawberry
dress and an orange in my hand, and Lena
said I was as pretty as her little sister, and
I asked if her little sister wore curls. And
she said, 'No, she don't ever does.' That
was the best Lena could talk.</p>

<p>"Then she gave me back the rings, and I
was going right to bed, so I put them in the
box on the bureau,&mdash;or I thought I did,&mdash;and
Lena stood at the door and looked at me
the whole time. I remember there was pink
cotton in the box, and the sweetest picture
on the cover. It was Miss Pike's box; she
has got it now.</p>

<p>"Then I went to bed, and Miss Pike set up
the screen between me and the gas-light, and
she read, and I went to sleep. How I did
sleep! I'd been playing blind-man's-buff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>and was so tired; and I never woke up next
morning till after Lijar had been in to fix the
fire, and Lena had been in to bring the clean
towels. The first thing I knew I opened my
eyes, and there were Miss Pike and Cora and
Kittyleen all laughing at me.</p>

<p>"'Come, you little sleepy girl,' said Miss
Pike; and she kissed me on both cheeks. I
never once thought about the rings, but got
up and let her curl my hair. She said it was
Washington's birthday, and curled a curl and
laughed, but I knew Kittyleen and Cora
were very hungry waiting.</p>

<p>"After breakfast they came up with me, and
so did Ethel and Phil. And I remember how
it rained, harder than it does now, ever so
much. And we stood by that beautiful window,
and looked out to see the soldiers parade.</p>

<p>"They didn't mind the rain, dripping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
their pretty caps and uniforms and white
gloves. First they put out one foot, and
then they put out the other foot, and at the
same time, to the music. Cora said it was
like wooden dolls, with joints in their knees.</p>

<p>"She didn't see that I hadn't any rings on
my fingers, and I didn't see it myself. We
were watching the soldiers on the street, and
the people on the pavement following on
after the soldiers. The people all had
umbrellas. You couldn't see their heads;
all you could see was umbrellas.</p>

<p>"The children wanted to dress up their dolls
like soldiers. They were girl dolls, with Kate
Greenaway dresses, but Miss Pike said they
could be woman's-rights soldiers, why not?
And she is so kind! She made some shiny
black soldier-caps, and we tucked up the
dolls' curls; and so cunning and brave as
they looked!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Afterwards I remember Miss Pike went
to the next room to read to Mrs. Garland,
and I waited for her; and the children went
down to lunch with mamma. But oh, when
they were all gone, then I thought of those
rings, and went to the box on the bureau.
But just think, grandma, they weren't there!
There was the pink cotton in the box, but
not a ring to be seen!</p>

<p>"A perfectly awful feeling went over me.
I know I must have turned pale, for I had to
pour my handkerchief wringing wet with
cologne. Why, just you think! Did you
ever have anything so terrible happen to
<i>you</i>? Why, those rings cost more money
than I had in this world! And Cora's
grandfather gave her the red ring, that
died!</p>

<p>"I hunted and hunted, under the bed and
under the rugs, and pulled the things out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the drawers. And I knew papa would have
to pay for them, and he'd think I was very
expensive! He would have to cure ever so
many sick people for it, and ride in the night
for days and days to pay for those rings!
'Specially the beautiful red one with white
currants round it. And she thinking so
much of her grandpa that died! I knew
she'd never forgive me, but always go
around with her head thrown back; and how
I should feel!</p>

<p>"I wished then I'd obeyed mamma, and
not borrowed what didn't belong to me. It
was just awful to have mamma and Miss
Pike know it. I wished I needn't be obliged
to tell."</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<small><small>THE HUNT.&mdash;FLAXIE'S STORY, CONTINUED.</small></small></h2>




<p>"When Miss Pike came in from reading to
Kittyleen's mother I was crying in the bed.</p>

<p>"First I wanted to say I was crying about
my silver mug that Kittyleen dented all up,
hitting it against the grate; and so I was&mdash;a
little. I could always cry about that!
But my truly tears were for the rings, and
I wouldn't let myself be so mean as not to
tell the truth. Besides, I wanted Miss Pike
to help me find them, you know.</p>

<p>"Then I told her; I <i>made</i> myself tell.
And she said, 'Ah, little Mary, you've been
borrowing again!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew she was displeased, because she
was so cool in her manner, and said 'little
Mary.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, please don't blame me,' said I. And
I told her I was sure Lena had stolen the
rings, for she knew where they were, and
saw me put them in the box. 'Oh, little
Mary, is that all the reason you have for saying
so?' said she. She thought it wasn't
any reason at all, unless I knew it was true.</p>

<p>"'But I do know it, Miss Pike,' said I.
'Lena always wanted those rings for her
little sister; and when she came in this
morning, and found me asleep, she could
take them as well as not. I always thought
she had a horrid face; she looks as if
she'd steal!'</p>

<p>"I spoke so sure and certain that I expected
Miss Pike would believe me and ring the bell
for Lena; and I was going to hide under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
bed when Lena came in. But instead of
that, she only stood there looking displeased,
and said 'Oh, little Mary' again.</p>

<p>"Then she talked about the Golden Rule,
and of course I didn't want to hear about
<i>that</i>, not just then. 'Was it kind to s'pect
people,' she said, 'was it right?'</p>

<p>"And I knew in my heart it wasn't, but I
thought Lena took those rings just the
same.</p>

<p>"Then Miss Pike began to hunt everywhere;
in all my pockets, and in my doll's pockets,
and in the waste-basket, and in the books, and
under the table. The more she hunted the
worse I felt. Every time she didn't find the
rings I kept thinking she'd say, 'Little
Mary,' again, and talk about 'hoping this
will be a lesson to you, little Mary.' But
she didn't. She was just as sweet! She
went with me to early dinner, and let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
have lady-fingers and ice-cream, and three
nuts and six raisins, just as she always
did.</p>

<p>"And after dinner she hunted again. She
took all the clothes out of the closet, and
shook them and put them back again; and
oh, I don't know what she didn't do, and it
was no use.</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>shall</i> I have to tell Cora?' said I.
And she said yes. I'd have to tell her and
mamma; but I needn't do it quite yet; not
till we'd hunted a little longer.</p>

<p>"Then she kissed me as if she loved me
after all, on both cheeks; and I sat down
and read 'Wonders of the Deep,' and cried.</p>

<p>"I remember how homely Lena looked to
me when I met her in the hall, and how I
despised her. I couldn't eat much supper,
and I didn't drink a drop of water,
because I'd been reading 'Wonders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Deep.' Now, water is all full of little live
things. I never used to know it, you see. I
used to swallow 'em, and not think.</p>

<p>"But no matter for the insects now. I was
talking about despising Lena; but you don't
know yet whether she was bad or not,
grandma. I'm telling it by degrees, to
make it sound like a story.</p>

<p>"Now we will go back to Lijar. Something
queer happened next morning. He didn't
come to fix the fire till it all went out, and
then a new man came. Lijar didn't come at
all. Miss Pike asked where he was, and the
new man said, 'In the lock up.' He said
he had been put in the lock-up for stealing.
Miss Pike thought it was very strange and
couldn't believe it, because she always liked
Lijar. 'What did he steal?' she asked.
And the new man said, 'A gold watch and
chain.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Then he stole those rings,' said I, as
quick as a flash. Miss Pike couldn't hush
me. I spoke right out before the fireman,
and told how Lijar took things off the mantel,
and looked at them with his dirty fingers
when I was asleep.</p>

<p>"I said I was so sorry <i>now</i> to think I'd
s'pected Lena, for I <i>knew</i> Lena was a good
girl, and 'twas Lijar that stole all the time.</p>

<p>"'Do please write a note to the President,'
said I, 'and ask him to make Lijar give back
those beautiful rings.'</p>

<p>"But Miss Pike never stirred. She said,
'Little Mary, you don't know any more
about Lijar to-day than you knew about
Lena yesterday. You're hasty again.' 'I
don't think I'm hasty, at all,' said I.
'Lijar is a horrid thief, or what did they
put him in the lock-up for? If he'd steal a
big watch, wouldn't he steal little rings? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
he'd steal one thing wouldn't he steal everything?'
said I. 'And <i>I</i> think the President
ought to know it.'</p>

<p>"But Miss Pike didn't pay the least attention,
only laughed. You know she has such
good judgment, and Doctor Papa says so himself.
I was glad afterward that she didn't
write to the President, for mother said it
wasn't the President's business to go to the
lock-up, and I suppose a letter would only
have bothered him. Besides, if he <i>had</i> gone,&mdash;well,
just you be patient, grandma!</p>

<p>"Miss Pike curled my hair, and I went
down to breakfast with the children; I wasn't
to say anything to Cora,&mdash;not yet. Miss
Pike was going to hunt again.</p>

<p>"I thought she was a very queer woman to
keep hunting when she <i>knew</i> it was no use.
I came back after breakfast feeling very bad,
for it seemed as if Cora had been looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
my hands all the while I was eating. I
opened the door of our room, and what do
you think? There stood Miss Pike, smiling,
and she had both those rings on a knitting-needle,
holding them up for me to see.</p>

<p>"'Look at your runaway rings,' said she.
I screamed right out, I was so happy.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Lijar, and it wasn't Lena.</p>

<p>"Miss Pike had found them in that room,
and you can't guess where.</p>

<p>"She had hunted in that bureau five hundred
and sixty times, and taken the things all
out. But this time she took out one of the
drawers, and sat down on the floor to look it
over. It was the next to the upper drawer
that she took out, and she happened to look
up at the empty place in the bureau where
the drawer belonged, and there she saw
something shining through a crack. It was
those rings, both of them. They had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
pushed into the crack and stuck there,&mdash;stuck
on a splinter.</p>

<p>"Miss Pike said of course I had put them in
the upper drawer, instead of the box. It was
because I was so sleepy. I don't see how
she ever found them, though, and she don't
see; for they were sticking to that splinter
very tight, and might have stuck there for
years and years, if she hadn't happened to
sit on the floor and look up, and catch them
shining.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandma, I tell you there wasn't a
feeling in me that wasn't happy! I went
right into Mrs. Garland's room, and laughed
right out before I could speak.</p>

<p>"'Here they are, Cora, your runaway
rings,' said I. She didn't know what I
meant till I told her how terribly they'd been
lost. And I said I'd never borrow them any
more. I didn't want to be an expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
girl, and my papa such a poor doctor. And
Mrs. Garland laughed and said, 'That is
right,' only she thought my father wasn't
such a <i>very</i> poor doctor.</p>

<p>"I wished Mrs. Garland had said Kittyleen
should stop borrowing, too. For Kittyleen&mdash;oh,
well, I try to be patient with little
Kittyleen!</p>

<p>"I met Lena coming out of our room,
smiling the pleasantest smile.</p>

<p>"'I did been to your room, Miss Mary,' said
she. She didn't tell about bringing a bunch
of violets, but that was what she brought.
She called them 'vi'lets,' when she gave
them to Miss Pike to put in water for me.
Why, it made me feel so cruel and unkind
and ashamed to smell those 'vi'lets.' She
bought them herself, Lena did. Oh, she
never knew what I'd said about her stealing
those rings for her little sister!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>"There, that's pretty near the end. Oh, no,
I forgot about Lijar. He hadn't stolen a
watch, or touched one. He hadn't stolen
anything. And he hadn't been put in the
lock-up, either. Perhaps somebody had been
put in the lock-up, but it wasn't Lijar.
Lijar had broken his leg, and that was all
that ailed <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"Miss Pike went to his house to see him,
and I went with her. It was a queer old
house full of children,&mdash;oh, ever so many
children. Lijar was in awful pain, so Miss
Pike said, but he didn't groan any, and of
course he couldn't possibly look pale, so you
wouldn't have known how much he was in
pain.</p>

<p>"He thanked us for the oranges, and his
wife said he was always good and kind, and
then she put her apron to her eyes and cried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>and told Miss Pike she'd rather be hurt herself
than to have her 'old man' hurt. Then
I felt cruel and unkind again, to think how
I'd called him horrid, when he wasn't horrid
at all, and it was another man that stole.</p>

<p>"There, grandma, I wouldn't tell this story
to anybody but you. But it's the very last
time I'll talk so about people, unless I know
it's certainly true. If Miss Pike <i>didn't</i> say,
'I hope this will be a lesson to you, little
Mary,' it will be a lesson all the same, I just
about know.</p>

<p>"And now, grandma, if you can spare me, I
must go out and talk with mamma and Miss
Pike about Ethel's party. Yes'm, it will
be Ethel's birthday to-morrow, the 20th of
March, and ever since we got home she has
been wanting a party. Mamma wasn't
going to let her have one. She said it
would be too much trouble, for her friends
are such little bits of things that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
mammas would have to come, too, to keep
them in order; and then <i>I</i> said, 'Oh,
mamma, if you are willing, you could let me
ask <i>my</i> little girls to a party, the little girls
of <i>my</i> age! Ethel likes them just as well as
<i>her</i> little girls, and she'd be ever so pleased;
and she does want a party so much!'</p>

<p>"Mamma thought it was a queer idea, but
I'm pretty sure she'll consent. It isn't for
<i>my</i> sake, you know, it's for Ethel, and we
can call it Ethel's kettledrum."</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<small><small>ETHEL'S KETTLEDRUM.</small></small></h2>



<p>Not long after this, "homely Miss Pike"
sat by the window in the back parlor, drawing
her thread in and out, in and out, of a
piece of pretty pink silk. Little Kittyleen,
who had returned from Washington, and as
usual spent most of her time at Dr. Gray's,
had been lying on the rug, gazing up wonderingly
at Miss Pike's large, wide mouth.</p>

<p>At last she broke forth suddenly, as if
thinking aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most everybody has whiskers, <i>don't</i> they,
Miss Pike?"</p>

<p>"Why, have <i>I</i> any whiskers, Kittyleen?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"No'm; but you've got some growing."</p>

<p>Miss Pike laughed softly to herself. She
had always known she was very plain, and of
course she was aware of the rather thick,
dark beard on her upper lip. Kittyleen's
little speech amused her, and yet the tears
sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>"If I had had my way about it," thought
she, "I should have had a form like this perfect
wax doll I am dressing, and very much
such a pink and white face, with wavy, soft
hair, the color of old gold; sweet, red lips,
straight nose, not a spot or a freckle anywhere.
Then the whole world would have
admired me, and I fancy it might be pleasant
to be admired.</p>

<p>"Ah, but the One who made me knew
what is best! If I can't be beautiful, I can
try to be good; and I'm not going to cry
about my homely body, for I'm sure to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>it behind me one of these days when I'm
called up to Heaven."</p>

<p>Then with a happy smile the excellent
young lady took the tape-measure out of
her work-basket and measured the slender,
round waist of "little miss," as she called
the doll.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Pike, where did you get that?
She's larger than my Princess Aurora
Arozarena, and I do believe she's handsomer,"
cried Flaxie, rushing in from the
kitchen, where she had been stoning raisins.
"Ethel told me you were dressing an elegant
doll, and I couldn't wait another minute to
see it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you think she's handsome,"
replied Miss Pike, trimming the silk
basque carefully. "I think myself she's
almost a perfect beauty. I fell in love with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>her last winter when we were in Washington,
and bought her instead of buying myself
a new bonnet."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Pike, how funny! I didn't
know young ladies ever wanted dolls.
Though why not?" she thought next minute.
Could anybody in the whole world
be so "grown up" as not to love that exquisite
"little miss," who sat up in Miss
Pike's lap with the most knowing of smiles,
as if she were just going to speak?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, young ladies love dolls," said
Miss Pike, embracing the waxen image tenderly,
as she fitted on the pink basque.
"But I think I shall give up mine. In fact,
I did not intend her for myself. I thought I
would buy her and give her to some poor
little girl, who never knew what it was to
have a good time. And now I'm hurrying
to get her dressed in season for Ethel's
party. Don't you think she'll look well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
there? And of course there'll be some poor
little girl among your guests, or perhaps a
sick little girl; and I'll give <i>her</i> the doll."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it?" said Flaxie, more surprised
than ever. She had not issued invitations
yet for her party,&mdash;or Ethel's
party,&mdash;and Miss Pike's words set her to
thinking.</p>

<p>Why, there were no poor little girls or any
sick ones who ever went to parties! The
children she played with were all well and
happy. They had pleasant homes&mdash;not
quite as pleasant as Flaxie's&mdash;and plenty
to eat and wear. But of course there were
other children in town.</p>

<p>"Let me think. Oh, there's Sadie Stockwell.
<i>She</i> is a poor girl."</p>

<p>Sadie was not exactly sick, but she was
lame. Something dreadful had happened to
her when she was a baby, and her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
seemed to be driven down between her
shoulders, as if she had no neck. She made
you think of a flower growing on a leaf-stalk
without any stem. Her face was sweet,
but sad and pale. She was shorter than
most little girls of her age, and walked
slowly and painfully with a pair of crutches.
Sadie was a good little girl. Why wasn't
she ever invited to parties? Flaxie did not
know why, only "somehow she never was."
She lived ever so far away from the other
girls; perhaps that was one reason.</p>

<p>Brother Preston was in the shed with
Rover, cracking walnuts for to-morrow's
candy. Sister Julia was in the kitchen,
finishing the raisins Flaxie had been stoning
for cake; and Dora Whalen stood by the
ironing-table, ironing the finest and best
damask table-cloth for Ethel's party, though
the table-cloth might have been as coarse as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the pony's red blanket and it would have
been all the same to the baby.</p>

<p>Flaxie walked about from room to room in
deep thought. Finally, she paused at the
open door of her mother's chamber, and
looked in. On the floor beside Mrs. Gray
stood a basket piled with very small dolls,
which she was dressing with strips of bright
ribbon, and bows of narrow taste. One of
these tiny dolls was to be placed under each
guest's plate, and carried home as a memento
of Ethel's first party.</p>

<p>"Mamma," asked Flaxie, still in a brown
study, "how many dollies did you buy, and
how many girls am I going to invite?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mary, here are twenty dollies. I
thought you and Ethel would each want one,
and I meant you should ask eighteen little
girls."</p>

<p>"Could I ask one more, mamma?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eighteen is a large number, Mary; isn't
it enough? Oh, do you want little Kittyleen?"</p>

<p>"Kittyleen, mamma? Why, no, indeed!
She'd spoil everything. I don't want Kittyleen!
I mean Ethel wouldn't want her;
it's Ethel's kettledrum, of course."</p>

<p>Flaxie was careful to say repeatedly, "It is
Ethel's kettledrum," lest she should forget
it was not her own.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, who is the 'one more,' if not
Kittyleen?"</p>

<p>Flaxie did not answer directly.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said she, "what do you suppose
Miss Pike said? She said <i>of course</i> I'd
have some poor girls and sick girls. Must I,
mamma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray felt a sudden pricking of conscience.
Why hadn't she thought of that
herself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor girls, Mary? Sick girls? Why, <i>of
course</i>, as Miss Pike says, they are the very
ones to enjoy your party, my daughter."</p>

<p>"Then, mamma, please buy another dolly,
and I'll ask Sadie Stockwell. She won't
take up a great deal of room. She never
goes anywhere except to school, and never
has any good times. I don't know what we
could do with her, though," added Flaxie,
with a puzzled look, "and I'm afraid the
other girls won't like it, for she can't play."</p>

<p>"But the girls <i>must</i> like it, my daughter.
You have all done wrong not to invite her to
your parties long ago, for she is an excellent
child, and never rough or ill-mannered. As
for entertaining her, you and Julia can talk
to her and show her your playthings and
picture-books, can't you? I'm sure, Mary,
you'll all be happier if you have Sadie."</p>

<p>"So I think, too," cried Flaxie, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>skipped away joyfully, her light curls flying
as she ran.</p>

<p>Sober little Sadie, who lived with eight
brothers and sisters in an old, worn-out
house, dressed in old, worn-out clothes, and
looked old and worn-out herself,&mdash;how her
solemn little face brightened at the unexpected
honor of an invitation to Flaxie's&mdash;no,
<i>Ethel's</i>&mdash;party! Mrs. Stockwell, too,
was very much gratified, especially as Mrs.
Gray had sent Sadie one of Flaxie's dresses,
a pretty blue cambric, which could be altered
over to fit her, as well as anything ever could
fit her poor, crooked little figure.</p>

<p>Happy Sadie! She rode next day with
Preston Gray in the little basket phaeton,
after Blackdrop, the pony, and she felt like
rubbing her eyes to make sure she was
awake. She smiled beamingly at the cunning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>little steed and his silver-mounted harness,
and at Rover, trotting now here and
now there. She smiled at her crutches,
which lay across the floor of the phaeton;
she smiled at the very mud-puddles which
winked back at her sleepily from the side
of the road. If there had been any grass,
she would have thought it was emeralds; if
there had been ice, she would have thought
it was diamonds.</p>

<p>When Preston lifted her from the phaeton
at his father's gate, and Mrs. Gray and
Flaxie both came out to meet her, followed
by Kittyleen, who was there, of course, she
hobbled up the path with a sparkle of joy and
expectation in her sad brown eyes.</p>

<p>The people of Laurel Grove had always
been kind to her, and given her mother
plenty of half-worn garments to "make over"
for all the family; but there are things that
poor children prize even more than old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>clothes, and nothing had ever seemed quite
so desirable to poor, lame Sadie as a little
girls' tea-party.</p>

<p>This was chiefly because parties were unknown
joys. She had dreamed of them, but
never seen them. How the little guests
amused themselves, and what they had to
eat, it would be worth a great deal to know.
Still, until to-day she had as little expectation
of ever going to a party, as of mounting an
owl's back and flying up to the moon.</p>

<p>Yet here she was. What a beautiful
house! What lovely pictures and books and
playthings and flowers! How very happy the
people must be who lived here all the time!</p>

<p>It is true she was a little frightened at first,
being a sensitive child, and not really sure
whether the party had begun or not. The
little girls kept arriving, one after another,
and they were all extremely kind; but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>body
thought to tell her the precise moment
when the party would begin.</p>

<p>By and by, however, Miss Pike, who seemed
in gay spirits, sprang up and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's all play 'Button, Button,' and immediately
bashful little Sadie felt quite at
home. Who would have thought of <i>such</i> a
game at an elegant party? And Miss Pike
hadn't gone half around with the button
before she let it fall, softly and slyly, into
Sadie's own hand."</p>

<p>This was another surprise.</p>

<p>Then, when the company were playing
blind-man's-buff, Miss Pike took Sadie into a
corner and began a long story, with Ethel
in her lap and Kittyleen by her side. Sadie
listened in rapture. No matter for the blind-man's-buff;
<i>she</i> didn't wish to play. No
matter for the "Magical Music," the "I
Spy," the "Marching on to Old Quebec."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Miss Pike's stories were better than all the
games in the world.</p>

<p>Besides, Flaxie and her friends never
seemed to forget Sadie, but kept coming up
between the pauses to say something pleasant.
They all agreed among themselves that
it was the nicest party they had ever attended,
and Kittyleen didn't spoil it; and
they said this to Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Flaxie, delighted, "then it's
Miss Pike that makes it so nice."</p>

<p>But she was mistaken. It was Sadie,
though nobody suspected it. They were all
trying to give the lame girl pleasure, and we
never make others happy without feeling
happy ourselves.</p>

<p>But the best was to come. Supper was
served, and all the girls were summoned to
the dining-room to a feast such as <i>one</i> of the
party had never seen before. Sandwiches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
cakes, tarts, pyramids of candy, glasses of
whipped cream; but what <i>was</i> that in the
middle of the table? A little "Lady Bountiful"
in a small chair. She was as large as
a child two years old, but no baby of that
age ever had such long, fair ringlets, such
starry eyes, such rosy cheeks, such a sweet-smiling
mouth, made up for endless kisses.</p>

<p>Her pink silk dress was trimmed with rich
lace, and bore a sweeping train. You could
just see in front the points of her tiny pink
boots; and as for her gloves, they were long
tan-colored kids,&mdash;the height of fashion,&mdash;and
buttoned from wrist to elbow.</p>

<p>Just before this marvel of beauty stood a
small light-stand, bearing a birthday cake on a
silver tray; and the beauty was pointing
sweetly with both hands at the cake, which
was a very large one, heavily frosted, and
marked in letters of cedar, "Ethel." But no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
one thought of the cake for looking at "little
miss." She was so wondrously bewitching,
so "alive looking" that they all exclaimed in
chorus, "Oh, what a beauty!" They wanted
to rush upon her and embrace her; but
being far too well-bred for that, they took
their seats in perfect order, only murmuring
over and over again to one another,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't she just too sweet for anything?"
All but Flaxie Frizzle's Kittyleen, who smothered
Flaxie with kisses, and teased her with
questions. Was it Ethel's doll? Who gave
it to her? Was <i>that</i> her kettledrum?</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Gray cut the birthday cake;
and while she was passing it, that roguish
Miss Pike stole up behind Ethel, and set a
beautiful wreath of flowers upon her head.
Everybody laughed as the little one suddenly
dropped her cake to the floor, and cried
"Oh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not till the close of supper that
a single word was said about the doll.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Gray remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suppose we pass her round and look at
her? But here is a piece of paper pinned to
her dress. We will read it first, and see what
it says."</p>

<p>She unpinned the paper and read aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I wish to be given to a sick little girl or
a lame girl.</i>"</p>

<p>It was half a minute before anybody could
take the sense of this. What, wasn't it
Ethel's doll, after all? Then they understood
it, and all cried out, "Oh, Sadie! Sadie!
Sadie!"</p>

<p>The poor bewildered child turned very
pale. This was too much happiness for her.
She wasn't used to anything like this. She
rose to her feet, caught up her crutches,&mdash;though
where she wanted to go she did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>not know,&mdash;dropped them, and fell down
crying.</p>

<p>But she was crying for joy. It wasn't
possible, no, surely it <i>wasn't</i> possible that
this loveliest of all presents was intended for
her.</p>

<p>And there was Miss Pike. She stood
holding the doll's trunk in her hand, full
of the dainty underclothing and every-day
dresses and outside wraps that she had been
making for weeks. But when she saw Sadie
crying I must confess she cried, too, though
she was intending to laugh. But you know
laughter and tears lie very near together.
And, indeed, it was very touching to everybody
when Sadie sobbed out, not knowing
any one heard her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> dolly! Oh, I never 'spected to have
such a good time as <i>this</i>, not till I went to
Heaven!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus ended Ethel's first party. And everybody
said it was a great success. "But
where was the kettledrum? I kept looking
and looking, and I didn't see it," mourned
Flaxie Frizzle's Kittyleen.</p>


<p class="p40">THE END.</p>
